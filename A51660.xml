            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>FAther <hi>Nicholas Malebranch</hi> was Born at <hi>Paris</hi> of a conſiderable Family, in the Year <hi>1638.</hi> His Eldeſt Brother is now one of the Counſellors in the firſt Chamber of the Parliament at <hi>Paris;</hi> where he is diſinguiſht by his Integrity, and other Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that are proper to make a good Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>When Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> became of Age to chooſe an Imployment ſuitable to his Birth and Inclination, his Parents propoſed to him to make him a Member of that Auguſt Body; but he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly refuſed ſo handſome an Eſtabliſhment, and thought rather of retiring from the World, and devoting himſelf to the Church.</p>
                  <p>To this End, he choſe the <hi>Congregation of
<pb facs="tcp:107782:4"/>the Prieſts of the Oratory;</hi> which continually ſupplies <hi>France</hi> with Learned Divines, Excellent Preachers, and Men capable of filing the moſt Eminent Dignities of the Church, Father <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch</hi> ſpent the firſt Years of his retreat in ſtudying Divinity and Languages, neceſſary for the underſtanding of Holy Scripture and other Eccleſiaſtic Authors. But as he felt a greater Pleaſure and Inclination for thoſe Sciences that are acquired by Reaſoning and Meditation, than for thoſe which depended only on Memory, and were founded upon Hiſtorical Facts, or the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Antient Authors; he reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with reading the Holy Scripture attentively, and imploying the reſt of his Time in the Study of Metaphyſics, and the knowledge of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Book intituled, <hi>A Search after Truth,</hi> was the firſt Fruit of his Meditations: Never was there any Book received with ſo great an Applauſe in <hi>France,</hi> nor in other Countries, where they are curious in matters of Reaſon and good Senſe. All the World was ſurprized to ſee a Young Philoſopher, who knew <hi>Man</hi> better than the Celebrated Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Maſter did at the end of his dayes; and who had found the ſecret of writing upon abſtracted things after ſo noble and polite a manner. The Able Men of <hi>France, Italy, Germany, England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> earneſtly ſought his Acquaintance, and gave him particular Marks of the Eſteem which they had
<pb facs="tcp:107782:4"/>conceived for him. Madam, the Princeſs <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> Palatine, that Illuſtrious Scholar of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> was ſo charmed with his <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> that ſhe reſolved to make it her Manual, and to have it alwayes with her: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Eſteem her moſt Serene Highneſs had for the Memory of Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> ſhe eaſily confeſſed, that Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> had out-done that great Philoſopher, as to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the knowledge of the Humane Mind, and the Conſequences of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Soul and Body. She wrote to her Siſter, Madam the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Louiſe,</hi> Abbeſs of <hi>Maubuiſſon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that ſhe was ſurprized, that having near her Abbey a Man of ſuch merit, ſo rare and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht, that ſhe had not ſought his Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. What was moſt great and extraordinary in <hi>Malebranch</hi> was, that he alwayes preſerved a Humility and Modeſty that was truly Chriſtian, in the midſt of all the Praiſes and Applauſes that he had received in his own Country and elſewhere. He was alwayes watchful over himſelf, and would not ſo much as hearken to ſo refin'd a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the greateſt Philoſophers of Antiquity have not been able to withſtand.</p>
                  <p>It was with extream Diſpleaſure that Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> obſerved afterwards that certain Perſons, otherwiſe perſwaded of the ſolidity of the Principles of the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philoſophy, which he had ſo happily explained, were not yet ſufficiently convinced of the Truth of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb facs="tcp:107782:5"/>and of the Morals of Jeſus Chriſt. Being troubled at the fatal blindneſs of theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, he reſolved to make uſe of the Principles in which they agreed with him, to prove to them the Corruption of Mans Heart, and the neceſſity of ſuch a Mediator as Jeſus Chriſt: To this end he Publiſh'd a little Book of <hi>Chriſtian Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations;</hi> and from that time, he only applyed himſelf to make uſe of the Truths which he had diſcovered, to prove the beauty and ſolidity of that Divine Philoſophy which Jeſus Chriſt teaches us in the Goſpel. What Glory, what Honour is it, for a Chriſtian Philoſopher to have ſet in ſo full, and ſo clear a light, the Reaſons, which we can now ſo advantageouſly uſe againſt Atheiſts, and the Enemies of the Goſpel. With the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> we may boldly defie the Atheiſts to explain to us how the Blood circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in their Veins, how they feel Pleaſure and Pain by means of certain Motions which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in their Body, without ſuppoſing the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and Action of an Infinite Perfect Being, who is only capable of puniſhing and rewarding us: And if this pretended ſtrength of Mind, of which our Atheiſts ſo much boaſt, is baffled when they conſider but a Bowl that is in motion, an agreeable titillation, or Pain which they feed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fire; what if we ſhould deſire them to explain the formation and increaſe of an almost infinite number of Organized Bodies; to tell us bow this vaſt Machine of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe could be
<pb facs="tcp:107782:5"/>formed and move of it ſelf, after ſo juſt and regulated a manner, in every thing that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for its Conſervation? What Comfort is it for us to learn, that even the irregularities which appear in the World, and concerning which the Enemies of our Religion reproach us with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Air, are certain marks of the infinite Perfection of the Author of Nature, who ought to act alwayes after a conſtant and uniform man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? So that the World would be a Work leſs worthy a Being ſoveraignly perfect, if it were not ſubject to the Irregularities, and ſeeming Diſorders, wherewith they reproach us. Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> had laid down all theſe great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in his <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> and has ſince proved, and admirably well illuſtrated them in his Treatiſe of <hi>Nature and Grace,</hi> in his <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Converſations,</hi> and <hi>Dialogues upon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſics.</hi> We are alſo obliged to him for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught us how to prove invincibly to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, that the Precepts of the Morals of Jeſus Chriſt are Remedies ſo efficacious againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Mind and Heart, and ſo proper to redreſs both, that every equitable Perſon muſt ingenuouſly acknowledge, theſe Remedies could not have been taught to the World, but even by his Wiſdom, who knew us perfectly: This is ſhowed in his <hi>Chriſtian Converſations,</hi> and in the Treatiſe of <hi>Morality,</hi> which Father <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche</hi> Publiſhed a little after.</p>
                  <p>Although the Book of <hi>Chriſtian Meditations</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:107782:6"/>was compoſed in imitation of the <hi>Soliloquies</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who endeavours to inſtruct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by conſulting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Reaſon, that is, the Wiſdom of God himſelf, and the Light which inlightens all Men: This manner of commerce betwixt us and the Divine Word, appeared wholly new and extraordinary to the <hi>French,</hi> who had ſeen nothing like it in their Language; even the Friends of Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> having received an Eſſay of the Work, told him freely, That they knew not whether a Book of this Nature would be well received in ſo nice and ridiculing an Age as ours. However the Author was not diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but continued his Book, and inrich'd it with noble and lively Expreſſions; and his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that was alwayes regular and fruitful, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with ſuch fine and happy Turns, that his Adverſaries were conſtrained to confeſs, that the Book impoſed upon them, and that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had the ſecret of ingaging his Reader, and making him reliſh his Sentiments, in a work, whoſe very Deſign was enough to deter them from reading it.</p>
                  <p>To content all the World, and explain yet further his Principles, which Perſons eminent for their Rank and Ability continually decryed, Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> ſometimes after, Publiſhed his Dialogues upon <hi>Metaphyſics</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> This is his Maſter-piece; the greatest Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencers of Antiquity in <hi>France</hi> acknowledged, that theſe Dialogues were not inferiour to thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:107782:6"/>of <hi>Plato.</hi> Indeed Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> has there ſhow'd as much Eloquence, Delicateneſs of Wit, and Elevation of Mind, as is to be met with in the Works of this <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſopher, whom the greatest Men, both Greeks and <hi>Latins,</hi> have look'd upon as their Maſter and Pattern.</p>
                  <p>Some of Father <hi>Malebranchs</hi> Friends, having deſired him to explain to them what he thought of the manner of reconciling Free-VVill with the operation of Grace, which acts immediately upon Mans VVill: He indeavoured to ſhow them, that the Syſtem of thoſe, who are called <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> is altogether contrary to Reaſon, and the Senſation we have of what paſſes in our ſelves. His Proofs appeared ſo clear and convincing to ſome of thoſe who conferr'd with him upon this matter, that they renounced the <hi>Janſenian</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, in favour of which they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in their Studies of Divinity. It was this that gave occaſion to Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> to write his Treatiſe upon <hi>Nature and Grace.</hi> He ſhewed the Manuſcript to ſeveral of his Friends, and was not diſpleaſed that they communicated it to Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who till then had appeared ſo charmed with Father <hi>Malebranchs</hi> Books, that he could not forbear ſpeaking well of them to all the World.</p>
                  <p>But it is a ſtrange and hard thing to incounter the favourite Prejudices of certain Men; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they look upon them as Truths of Faith, for which they will be Martyrs. The
<pb facs="tcp:107782:7"/>Treatiſe of <hi>Nature and Grace</hi> appeared to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and his Diſciples, as a dangerous Book, and full of Hereſies; the Author, whom that Party had admired ſo long as they believed him no Enemy of the Opinions of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> became all of a ſudden an <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> and the moſt wretched Philoſopher that had ever appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> before he ingaged in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act refutation of that Treatiſe, thought fit to ridicule his new Adverſary, and make him paſs for a Man who believes he ſees God, and ſuppoſes him Corporeal. This was the deſign that Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> propoſed to himſelf in his Book of <hi>True and falſe Ideas;</hi> he ſaid nothing there which had any relation to the Diſpute upon Grace and Free-Will, he indeavoured only to divert the Reader upon account of a particular Sentiment of F. <hi>Malebranchs</hi> about the Nature of Ideas: An Opinion which he had read ſome Years before in the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> and againſt which he had nothing to object, till the Treatiſe of <hi>Nature and Grace</hi> was unhappily Printed.</p>
                  <p>This procedure, ſo little becoming a Man of Monſieur <hi>Arnauds</hi> Reputation, troubled Father <hi>Malebranch,</hi> who ſhowed the Injuſtice thereof, and proved in his Anſwer to Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> that this Doctor was pleaſed to diſguiſe, or at leaſt did not well underſtand, the Sentiment which he would oppoſe. Certain Perſons will hardly be perſwaded that Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> (a Name
<pb facs="tcp:107782:7"/>that included every thing amongſt the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi>) did not well underſtand the Sentiment of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary which he was willing to refute with ſo much pains and application. But does not Paſſion and Prejudice deceive the greateſt Genius's? Is it not this which often hinders them from compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending what others leſs prejudiced conceive eaſily?</p>
                  <p>After ſome Conteſtations upon the Miracles of the Old Teſtament, Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> came to the principal Queſtion, which regards the manner how Grace acts in Man. This is not a place to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what was ſaid on either ſide, nor does it concern the <hi>Search after Truth.</hi> I ſhall only add, that if Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends to have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved that Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> favours <hi>Semipelagianiſm,</hi> Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> might alſo reply, that he had evidently ſhowed Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> maintained the Opinions of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſome other Reformers, condemned in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Jeſuit having bethought himſelf to Publiſh a Book againſt Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, under the borrowed name of <hi>Louis de la Ville,</hi> and to accuſe them to the Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> as Innovators, who overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and ſome other Articles commonly received in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Author of the <hi>Search after Truth</hi> was not forgot in the Catalogue of theſe new He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. F. <hi>Malbranche</hi> contented himſelf with a ſhort Anſwer to this Adventurer, whom the
<pb facs="tcp:107782:8"/>Prelates of <hi>France</hi> would not ſo much as hear. Certainly it muſt be confeſt, that theſe Gentlemen carried it very prudently in ſo nice a conjuncture: For if they had declared that the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy overthrew the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> they would have found that the greateſt part of the beſt Wits in <hi>France</hi> do not believe it: And was not this to put the King of <hi>France</hi> under an unhappy neceſſity of ſending Dragoons into the Monaſteries and Societies, and to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of honeſt Men, to cauſe them to abjure the Errours of the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philoſophy? So true is it that Devotees do not always ſee the fatal Conſequences of an Advice which impetuous Zeal dictates to thoſe that are in Authority.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Regis,</hi> well known by the Philoſophy he has Publiſhed, having undertaken to oppoſe ſome Sentiments of F. <hi>Malebranch:</hi> this Father neglected at firſt to Anſwer his new Adverſary; but when Monſieur <hi>Regis</hi> would have drawn an advantage from the ſilence of a Man who plainly perceived himſelf unfairly attack'd, Father <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche</hi> publiſhed the laſt Year a ſhort Anſwer to Monſieur <hi>Regis.</hi> The name of Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> was made uſe of in this Conteſtation, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned him to appear again upon the ſtage. In the <hi>Journal des Scavans</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> he Printed two Letters addreſt to F. <hi>Malebranch,</hi> who ſoon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, and gave two Letters to the <hi>Journa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi> that were alſo Printed. Monſieur <hi>Couſin</hi> left off his Correſpondence with Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:107782:8"/>and refuſed to put in his <hi>Journal</hi> other Letters which M. <hi>Arnaud</hi> had written a little before his Death; we ſhall doubtleſs ſee them in his Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous works; for it is not probable that they will rob the Publick of the Remains of ſo great a man. We ſhall be gainers thereby two wayes; F. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche</hi> will break that ſilence which he ſeems to have condemned himſelf to, and we ſhall have new Explanations upon ſome important Difficult ties which M. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may have found in the VVorks of ſo hard an Adverſary.</p>
                  <p>I have but one thing more to ſay of F. <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch:</hi> It is; that his Heart agrees perfectly with his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding: There is as much <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs in the one, as Juſtneſs in the other: He is a Chriſtian Philoſopher, who acts as he thinks. Never did any Man more perfectly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Manners and Actions upon the Principles of his Philoſophy; Being perſwaded that God is the only cauſe which acts truly upon our Body and in our Soul. F. <hi>Malebranch</hi> accuſtoms himſelf, upon every Senſation, upon every Perception, to elevate himſelf always towards the Supreme Being, to humble himſelf in his Preſence, and to praiſe him continually: VVith what aſſurance does not he (as often as it's poſſible) approach to the Throne of Grace of the Eternal High Prieſt, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually intercedes for us? VVith what fervour does he not beg to be admitted as a Living Stone in the Structure of the Myſterious Temple, which this Divine Architect builds up to the Glory of
<pb facs="tcp:107782:9"/>his Father? He is in a continual watchfulneſs and attention over himſelf, to divert the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which ſenſible Objects may make upon his Body, and to ſtop whatever is capable of exciting the Paſſions. He is the moſt ſober and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man in the World.</p>
                  <p>And if F. <hi>Malebranch</hi> ſo exactly obſerves his Duties towards God and himſelf, he is not leſs regular in thoſe which reſpect his Neighbour, He is tender and compaſſionate to the unhappy, courteous and affable to all the VVorld, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſincere in reſpect of his Friends, good and indulgent to all thoſe who injure him; Being perſwaded, that the Love of his Neighbour ought to have for its principal end, that Eternal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to which we are called by the Goſpel. He endeavours to inſpire all thoſe who come near him, with Sentiments of Piety and Religion; to procure as much as he can their Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which he earneſtly deſires day and night. In a word, F. <hi>Malebranch</hi> has drawn his own Pourtraiture in his Treatiſe of <hi>Morality:</hi> To compoſe the greateſt part of which, he had no need of long and new Reflexions upon the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Man: He hath told us, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, what he exactly practiced after he had applied himſelf to the regulation of his Manners upon the Truths he had ſo attentively Meditated, and ſo happily Explained.</p>

                        <p>THE Mind of Man has two eſſential or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary relations, which are very different, the one to God, and the other to its Body; as it is a <hi>pure Spirit</hi> it is eſſentially united to the Word of God, to the Eternal Wiſdom and Truth, for 'tis only by this Union that it is capable of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107782:10"/>thinking, as has been ſhewn in the 3d Book; as an <hi>humane Spirit</hi> it has an eſſential relation to its Body, and becauſe of this union, it is ſenſible, and imagines, as has been explained in the Firſt and Second Books. I call that <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>imagination</hi> of the Mind when the Body is the natural or occaſional cauſe of its thoughts, and that <hi>underſtanding</hi> when it acts of it ſelf, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when God acts in it, or when his light enlightens it after many different manners, independantly of any thing whatever that paſſes in its Body.</p>
                        <p>'Tis the ſame in reſpect of the <hi>humane Will;</hi> as a <hi>Will,</hi> it eſſentially depends upon the Love which God bears to himſelf, upon the Eternal Law, in a word upon the Will of God; 'Tis only becauſe God loves himſelf that we love any thing, and if God did not love himſelf, or if he did not continually imprint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul of Man a Love like to his, I mean that motion of Love which we receive for good in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, we ſhould love nothing, we ſhould will nothing, and conſequently we ſhould be without any will, ſince the will is nothing elſe but the impreſſion of Nature which carries towards good in general, as we have often ſaid before, <hi>Book</hi> I. <hi>Ch.</hi> I. and elſewhere.</p>
                        <p>But the Will as it is an <hi>humane Will,</hi> eſſentially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Body, for 'tis only from the motions of the Blood and Spirits, that it perceives it ſelf agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with all ſenſible Emotions; I therefore give the name of Natural Inclinations to all the motions of the Soul which are common to us with pure Intelligences, and ſome of thoſe in which the Body has a great ſhare, but whereof it is only indirectly the Cauſe and the End, as I have explained in the preceding Book; and here I deſign by the word <hi>Paſſions</hi> all the Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Soul naturally feels by means of the extraordinary Motions of the Animal Spirits and Blood, Theſe are the ſenſible Emotions which ſhall be the Subject of this Book.</p>
                        <p>Although the Paſſions are inſeparable from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and Men were no farther capable of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible love or hatred than as they are capable of the mental, yet I thought it would not be amiſs to treat
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107782:10"/>diſtinctly of 'em to avoid confuſion; Thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Paſſions are much more ſtrong and lively than the Natural Inclinations, for other Objects, and which are always produced from other Cauſes, will acknowledge, that 'tis not without reaſon that I have ſeparated things that are inſeparable in their nature.</p>
                        <p>Men are only capable of Senſations and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as they are capable of pure Intellections, the Senſes and Imagination being inſeparable from the Mind, however no one has oppoſed a diſtinct Treatiſe of theſe two Faculties of the Soul, although they are naturally inſeparable.</p>
                        <p>In fine, the Senſes and Imagination don't differ any more from the pure Underſtanding, than the Paſſions do from the Inclinations, ſo that we muſt diſtinguiſh theſe two laſt Faculties as it has been uſual to do with the three firſt, that we may be better able to diſcern what the Soul receives from its Author by means of the Body, from that which it has from him independant of the Body. The only inconvenience that will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſult from the diſtinction of theſe two things thus naturally united, will be (as it happens upon like occaſions) a neceſſity of repeating ſome things which have been already ſaid.</p>
                        <p>Man is one, although compoſed of many parts; and the union of theſe parts is ſo ſtrict, that it can't be touch'd in one place without affecting the whole: all his Faculties have ſuch a mutual dependance upon one another, and are ſo ſubordinate, that 'tis impoſſible to explain any one of 'em without ſpeaking ſomething of the other; Thus by endeavouring to avoid confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I am obliged 10 repetition, but 'tis better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat than confound, becauſe my buſineſs is to write as clear as I can, and in this neceſſity of repetition, I can only endeavour ſo to repeat as not to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to my Reader.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the Soul are Impreſſions of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature, which incline us to love out Body, and whatever may be uſeful to its preſervation: as the Natural Inclinations are the Impreſſions of the ſame Author, which chiefly incline us to love him as the Soverain Good.</p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107782:11"/>
                        <p>The natural or occaſional Cauſe of theſe Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is the motion of the Animal Spirits to beget and cheriſh an agreeable diſpoſition to the Object which is perceived; ſo that the Mind and Body are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſſiſtant on this occaſion. For 'tis the Order of God, that the Motions of our Body which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to execute the Order of our Will ſhould follow it, and that the Motions of our Body which are mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically excited in us at the ſight of any Object, ſhould be accompanied with a paſſion of our Soul which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to will that which appears uſeful to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; 'tis this continual impreſſion of the Will of God upon us, which ſo ſtrictly unites us to a portion of Matter, and if this impreſſion of his Will ſhould but ceaſe for one moment, we ſhould from that moment be, freed from the dependance we have upon all the changes which happen to our Body.</p>
                        <p>I can't comprehend how ſome perſons imagine that there is an abſolutely neceſſary connection between the Motions of the Spirit and Blood, and the Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul, ſome little particles of Choler are violently mov'd in the Brain, therefore the Soul muſt neceſſarily be agitated with ſome Paſſion, and this Paſſion muſt rather be Anger than Love; What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation can be conceived betwixt the Idea of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Imperfection, a Paſſion of Contempt or Hatred, and betwixt the Corporeal Motion of ſome Particles of Blood which beat againſt ſome parts of the Brain? How can a Man perſwade himſelf of ſuch a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance? and that the Union or Alliance of two things ſo different and incompatible as <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> can be cauſed and preſerved after any other manner than by the continual, and Almighty, and Omnipotent Will of the Author of Nature?</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who think that Bodies do neceſſarily and of themſelves communicate Motion in the moment of their Concourſe, think ſomething like truth, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this prejudice has ſome foundation, Bodies ſeem to have an eſſential relation to Bodies, but the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> are two kinds of Beings ſo oppoſite, that thoſe who think the Emotions of the Soul do neceſſarily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107782:11"/>follow the Motions of the Spirits and Blood, think ſomething that has not the leaſt appearance of truth, certainly 'tis only our own Conſciouſneſs of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe two Beings, and our Ignorance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Operations of God upon his Creatures, which makes us imagine another Cauſe of the Union of our Soul and Body beſides the Will of God.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to determine whether this relation or connexion of the thoughts of Mans Mind with the Motion of his Body, is the Puniſhment of Sin or the Gift of Nature, and ſome Perſons believe it would be raſhneſs to decide either way; 'tis well known that Man before Sin was no Slave, but abſolate Maſter of his Paſſions, and by his Will did eaſily ſtay the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood which cauſed them; But I ſhould be hardly perſwaded that the Body did not ſollicite the Soul of the firſt Man to an enquiry after things which were proper for the preſervation of his Life, or that <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall was inſenſible that Fruits were agreeable to his ſight, and pleaſant to his taſte, eſpecially if I may believe the Scripture, and that this ſo juſt, ſo marvellous an Oeconomy of his Senſes and Paſſions for the preſervation of his Body was a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Nature rather than the firſt Inſtitution.</p>
                        <p>Doubtleſs Nature is now corrupted, the Body acts with too much power upon the Mind, inſtead of ſubmiſſively repreſenting to it its neceſſities, it ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizes over it, and raviſhes it from God, to whom it ought to be inſeparably united, and continually prompts it to a purſuit of ſuch ſenſible things as may be proper for its conſervation, the Mind is become as it were immaterial and earthy by Sin, that relation and Eſſential Union which it has with God is loſt, I mean God has withdrawn himſelf from it, as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible without deſtroying or annihilating it. Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſorders have followed the abſence or eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him who kept it in order, and without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a longer enumeration of our Miſeries, Man is by the fall throughly corrupted in all his parts.</p>
                        <p>But this fall has not deſtroyed the Work of God, that which God gave to the firſt Man is always ſound
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107782:12"/>in him, the immutable Will of God which conſtitutes the Nature of every thing, was not changed by the levity and inconſtancy of <hi>Adam</hi> s Will: every thing that God did Will he yet Wills, and becauſe his Will is efficacious, he effects whatever he Wills. Mans Sin was indeed the occaſion that the Divine Will did not conſtitute the Order of Grace, but Grace is not contrary to Nature, the one deſtroys not the other; Becauſe God fights not againſt himſelf, he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and his Wiſdom having no limits, his Works will have no end.</p>
                        <p>The Will of God which conſtitutes the Order of Grace is joined to that Will which effects the Order of Nature, not to change it, but to repair it. There are only two General Wills in God, and whatever is well regulated in the World depends upon one of theſe; The Paſſions are very well ordered, if they are only conſidered in order to the Bodies preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although they ſometimes deceive us in few and particular Caſes, which the Univerſal Cauſe has not willed to remedy; we may then conclude that the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are of the, Order of Nature, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of the Order of Grace. It is true, if we conſider that the Sin of the firſt Man has deprived us of the aſſiſtance of a God that is Omnipreſent, and always ready to defend us, it may then be ſaid that Sin is the Cauſe of our relation to <hi>ſenſible things,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has ſeparated us from God by whom only we can be delivered from their Slavery.</p>
                        <p>But without inſiſting any longer upon an Enquiry after the full Cauſe of our Paſſions, let us examine their extention, their nature in particular, their end, their uſe, their defects, and whatever relates to 'em.</p>

                        <p>The moſt honourable Sect of Philoſophers, and that whoſe Opinions many Men do now think it their glory to embrace, would perſwade us that it is in our own power to be happy : The <hi>Stoics</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually tell us of ſelf dependance,<note place="margin">Jam beatum eſſe te judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca cum tibi in te gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium omne naſc. tur: cum in his que homines eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt, optant, cuſtediunt, nihil inveneris, non d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           </note> that we muſt not be afflicted at the loſs of our Reputation, Goods, Friends, or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; That we muſt be always of an even temper of Mind, and eaſie whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, whether Exile, Injuries, Affronts, Diſtempers, and even Death it ſelf, for theſe are not Evils to be feared; In fine, they tell us of many ſuch like things, which we are enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, as well becauſe our Pride makes us in love with Independence, as becauſe our Reaſon tells
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107782:13"/>us, that indeed the greateſt part of theſe Evils which really afflict us, were incapable of doing it, if all things were in order.</p>
                        <p>But God has given us a Body, and by this Body united us to all ſenſible things; Sin has ſubjected us to our Body, and by our Body has made us depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon all ſenſible things; This is the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this is the Will of the Creator, that all Beings which he hath made ſhould be united together; thus we are united to all things, and 'tis the Sin of the firſt Man which has made us dependent upon all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to which God has only allied us; Thus is there none that is not now united and wholly ſubjected to his Body, and by his Body to his Relations, his Friends, his City, his Prince, his Country, his Clothes, his Houſe, his Lands, his Horſe, his Dog, to all the Earth, the Sun, the Stars, to all the Heavens.</p>
                        <p>'Tis therefore ridiculous to tell Men, that it is in their power to be Happy, Wiſe, and Free, and they only mock thoſe whom they ſeriouſly adviſe not to be afflicted at the loſs of their Friends or Goods, 'tis even as ridiculous to adviſe Men not to feel pain when they are beaten, or not to be pleaſed when they eat with an appetite; Thus the Stoics are either unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or mock us when they preach to us to be eaſie under the death of a Father, the loſs of Goods, Exile, Impriſonment, and ſuch like things, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the good ſucceſs of our Affairs, for we are united to our Country, our Goods, our Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by a Natural Tye, which now depends not upon our Will.</p>
                        <p>Indeed I cenfeſs that Reaſon teaches us to ſuffer Exile chearfully, but the ſame Reaſon tells us we ought to endure the cutting off an Arm without pain; The Soul is above the Body, and according to the light of Reaſon, a Man's happineſs or unhappineſs ought not to depend upon it; but Experience ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proves to us that things are not as our Reaſon tells us they ſhould be, and it is ridiculous to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize againſt Experience.</p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107782:13"/>
                        <p>Chriſtians dont philoſophize after this manner, they confeſs that pain is an evil, that it is not without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs that they are raviſhed from thoſe things to which Nature has united them; and that it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to be delivered from the ſlavery into which Sin has reduced us. They grant that it is a diſorder that the Soul depends upon the Body, yet ſo as that it may be delivered from this dependence by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>I feel,</hi> ſays St. Paul, <hi>a law in my Body which fights againſt the law of my Mind, and which enſlaves it to the Law of Sin which is in my Members; unhappy Man that I am! Who ſhall deliver me from this Body of death? it will be the Grace of God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Son of God, the Apoſtles, and all his true Diſciples do recommend patience to us above all things, becauſe they knew that he that will live holily muſt endure affliction. In ſhort, true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or true Philſophers ſay nothing which is not agreeable to good Senſe and Experience, but Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Nature does continually contradict the Opinion or Pride of the Stoics.</p>
                        <p>Chriſtians know, that to deliver themſelves in ſome manner from the dependance they are in, they muſt labour to deprive themſelves of all things which they cannot enjoy without pleaſure, nor be deprived of without pain; that that is the only means to preſerve the peace and liberty of Mind, which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Grace of their Saviour. The Stoics on the contrary following the falſe Idea's of their Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Philoſophy imagined themſelves wiſe and happy, and that there needed no more than to think on Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Independence, to become Virtuous and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant. Reaſon and Experience tells us, the beſt way not to ſuffer the pain of pricking, is to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prick'd. But the Stoics ſay, Prick me, and by the force of my Mind, and help of my Philoſophy, I will ſeparate my ſelf after ſuch a manner from my Body, that I will not feel whatever paſſes there. I can demonſtrate, that my happineſs depends not upon it, that pain is not an evil; and you ſhall ſee by the air of my Face, and firm poſture of all the reſt of

                        <p>Their Pride maintains their Courage; but it does not hinder them from effectively ſuffering Pain with ſome inquietude, nor prevent them from being Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Thus the union they have with their Body is not deſtroyed, nor their pain diſſipated; but the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have with other Men, fortified by the deſire of their eſteem, in ſome meaſure reſiſts this other union they have with their own Bodies. The ſenſible ſight of thoſe who look upon them, and to whom they are united, ſtays the courſe of the ſpirits which accompany pain, and effaces the air that would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on their Countenance; for if no body looked upon them, this air of Conſtancy and freedom of Mind would immediately vaniſh. Thus the Stoics only in ſome meaſure reſiſt the union that they have with their Bodies, by becoming greater Slaves to other Men, to whom they are united by the paſſion of glory. 'Tis then a certain truth, that all Men are united to all ſenſible things, both by Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence; we ſufficiently diſcover it by Experience, although Reaſon ſeems to oppoſe it, and almoſt all the actions of Men are ſenſible and demonſtrative proofs of it.</p>
                        <p>Though this union is common to all Men, yet it is not of an equal extenſion and power in all; for it follows the knowledge of the Mind; we may ſay we are not actually united to unknown Objects; a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman in his Cottage does not intereſt himſelf in the glory of his Prince or Country, but only in that of his own or Neighbouring Villages, becauſe his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge extends no farther.</p>
                        <p>The union we have to ſuch ſenſible Objects as we have ſeen, is ſtronger than that we have to thoſe we have imagined, and which we have only heard of. 'Tis by Senſation that we unite our ſelves more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſenſible things; for Senſation produces much greater Traces in the Brain, and excites a much more violent motion in the Spirits than the Imagination only.</p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:107782:15"/>
                        <p>This union is not ſo ſtrong in thoſe who continually oppoſe it, that they may adhere to the goods of the Mind, as in others who follow the motions of their Paſſions, and permit themſelves to be ſubjected to them; for deſire augments and fortifies this union.</p>
                        <p>In fine, different Employs, different Conditions, as well as different Diſpoſitions of Mind, make a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable difference in the ſenſible Union that Men have with Earthly Goods. The great are united to many more things than others, their ſlavery is farther extended. A General of an Army is united to all his Soldiers, becauſe they all reverence him: This ſlavery often creates valour; and the deſire of being eſteemed of all thoſe who look upon him, often obliges him to ſacrifice other more ſenſible and more reaſonable deſires to it. It is the ſame with thoſe that are in power, or that are popular. 'Tis vanity often which animates their vertue; becauſe the love of glory, is commonly ſtronger than the love of truth. I ſpeak here of the love of glory, not as a ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, but as a paſſion; becauſe indeed this love may be ſenſible, and it is often accompanied with very lively and violent emotions of the ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>Different Ages and Sexes are alſo the chief cauſes of the Paſſions of Men. Children do not love the ſame things, as the adult and aged do; or, at leaſt, not with ſo much force and conſtancy. Women are united only to their Family and Neighbourhood, but Men to their whole Country; 'Tis their part to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, they chooſe great Places, Honours, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                        <p>There is ſo great a variety in the Employments and Affairs of Men, that it is impoſſible to expreſs it. The diſpoſition of the Mind of a Married Man is not the ſame with one that is a Batchelor; the care of his Family does often wholly take up his thoughts. Monks have neither a Mind nor a Heart inclined like other Men, nor even like other Eccleſiaſticks, they are united to fewer things, but they are more ſtrongly united to them. We may thus ſpeak in general of the different Conditions of Men; but we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107782:16"/>the little ſenſible engagements which are almoſt all of them different in each particular Perſon; for it often enough happens that Men have particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements entirely oppoſite to thoſe they ought to have in reference to their Condition. But although we may in general terms expreſs the different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Mind, the different Inclinations of Men and Women, old and young, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, and in ſhort of the different Sexes, Ages, and Employment, Yet theſe things are too well known to thoſe who live in the World, and who reflect upon what they ſee, to ſwell this Volume with them. We need but open our Eyes to be agreeably and ſolidly inſtructed in theſe things. For thoſe who chooſe rather to read them in <hi>Greek,</hi> than to learn them by any reflexion upon what paſſes before their Eyes; I refer them to the Second Book of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Rhetorick; which I believe is the beſt Piece of that Philoſopher's, becauſe few things are there ſaid that can deceive us, thô he ſeldom proves what he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</p>
                        <p>It is then evident, that this ſenſible Union of the Mind of Men, with whatever has any relation to the preſervation of their lives, or the Society whereof they conſider themſelves as Members, is different in different Perſons, ſince it is moſt extenſive in thoſe that have moſt knowledge, are moſt noble, have the higheſt Employments, and greateſt Imaginations; and and that it is more ſtrict and ſtronger in thoſe who are moſt Senſible, have the moſt lively Imagination, and who moſt blindly follow the motions of their Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>It is very uſeful often to reflect upon the almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Manners whereby Men are tied to ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and one of the beſt ways to become very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe things, is to ſtudy and obſerve our ſelves. 'Tis by the experience of what we feel in our ſelves, that we are inſtructed in the knowledge of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of other Men, and of the Paſſions they are ſubject to: But if to theſe Experiments we add the knowledge of their particular Engagements, and that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107782:16"/>of the Judgments proper to each of the Paſſions, of which we ſhall afterwards ſpeak, it may be we ſhall not have ſo much difficulty to gueſs at the greateſt part of their Actions, as Aſtronomers have to predict Eclipſes. For although Men are free, it is very rare that they make a good uſe of their liberty, againſt their natural inclinations and violent paſſions.</p>
                        <p>Before we end this Chapter we muſt farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that it is one of the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, that all the Inclinations of the Soul, even of thoſe it has for the goods that have no relation to the Body, are accompanied with the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Animal Spirits, which make theſe Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſenſible; becauſe Man, not being a pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it is impoſſible that he ſhould have any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo pure as to have no mixture of any paſſion. Thus the love of Truth, Juſtice, and of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is always accompanied with ſome Traces of the Brain, which renders this knowledge more lively, but commonly more confuſed. It is true, that very often we do not diſcover that our Imagination is a little employed, at the ſame time we conceive an Abſtracted Truth: The reaſon is, becauſe theſe Truths have no Images or Traces inſtituted by Nature to repreſent them, and all Traces which ſtir them up have no other relation to them, but that of Mans Will, or chance which has ſo placed them. For Arithmeticians, and even Algebraiſts, who only conſider Abſtracted Things, often make uſe of their Imaginations to keep their Minds fixt upon theſe Idea's. Cyphers, Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical Letters, and other Figures which they ſee or imagine, are always joined to theſe Ideas; although the Traces which are formed by theſe Characters have no relation to them, and ſo can make them neither falſe nor confuſed: And thus by a regulated uſe of Figures and Letters, they diſcover the moſt difficult Truths, which otherwiſe it would be impoſſible to find out.</p>
                        <p>The Idea's of things which can only be perceived by the pure Underſtanding, may then be connected to the Traces of the Brain; and the fight of Objects
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107782:17"/>that we love, hate, and fear by a Natural Inclination, may be accompanied with the motion of the Spirits: It is plain that the thought of Eternity, the fear of Hell, the hopes or an Eternal Happineſs, although they be Objects that ſtrike not the Senſes, yet may excite violent Paſſions in us.</p>
                        <p>So that we may ſay we are united after a ſenſible manner, not only to all things that relate to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Life; but alſo to Spiritual things to which the Mind is immediately united by it ſelf. It even happens very often: that Faith, Charity, and Self-love make this union to Spiritual things ſtronger, than that whereby we are joined to all ſenſible things. The Souls of true Martyrs are more united to God than to their Bodies; and thoſe who die to maintain the truth of a falſe Religion, ſufficiently ſhew that the fear of Hell has more power over them than the fear of death has. There is often ſo much heat and prejudice on both ſides in Religious Wars, and in the defence of Superſtitions, that we cannot doubt but there is ſome Paſſions in them; and ſuch a one as is ſtronger and much more conſtant than any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is built upon an appearance of Reaſon, as well in thoſe that are deceived as in others.</p>
                        <p>We are then by our Paſſions united to what ever appears to us to be a good or evil to the Mind, as well as to what ever ſeems to be ſo to the Body. There is nothing which we can diſcover to have any relation to us, which is not capable of affecting us; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the things that we know, there is none that has not ſome relation to us: We have always ſome intereſt even in the moſt abſtracted Truths, when we know them, becauſe at leaſt there is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of knowledge between them and our Minds. They are ours, if I may ſo ſay, by our knowledge. We feel that they hurt us when we diſpute them, and if they hurt us, it is certain that they agitate and diſquiet us. Thus the Paſſions have ſo vaſt a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and extenſion, that it is impoſſible to conceive any thing in reſpect to them, whereof we could be certain, although all Men were exempt from their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107782:17"/>empire. But let us now ſee what their Nature is, and endeavour to diſcover all things they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> A particular Explanation of all the changes that happen to the Body and Soul by means of the Paſſions.</head>
                        <p>WE may diſtinguiſh ſeven things in each of our Paſſions, except in Admiration, which alſo is but an imperfect Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is the Judgment the Mind makes of an Object, or rather the confuſed, and diſtinct view of the relation this Object has to us.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is a new determination of the motion of the Will towards this Object, ſuppoſing it be, or appears to be a good. Before this view the Natural Motion of the Soul, either was intermixed, <hi>viz.</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards good in general, or it was otherwiſe determined by the knowledge of ſome other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Object. But in that moment the Mind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the relation this new Object had to it, this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Motion of the Will is forthwith determined conformably to what the Mind perceives. The Soul draws near to this Object by its love, that it may taſte it, and diſcover its good by the ſenſation of ſweetneſs, which the Author of Nature gives it as a Natural Recompence for its inclining to good. It judged that this Object was a good by an abſtracted Reaſon which affected it not; but it remains con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the efficacy of Senſation, and the more lively this Senſation is, the ſtronger it unites to the good it ſeems to produce.</p>
                        <p>But if this particular Object be conſidered as evil, or as capable of depriving us of any good, no new determination happens to the Motion of our Will; but only an augmentation of Motion towards the good oppoſite to this Object which appears, an evil,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107782:18"/>which augmentation is ſo much the greater, as the appearing Evil is more to be feared. For indeed, we hate only becauſe we love, and an External Evil is judged as ſuch, only becauſe it deprives us of ſome good: Thus Evil being conſidered as the privation of Good, to fly Evil, is but to fly the privation of Good, which is the ſame thing as to incline towards good. There happens no new determination then in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motion of the Will at the meeting with an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which diſpleaſes us; but only a ſenſation of pain, diſguſt, or bitterneſs that the Author of Nature has imprinted in the Soul as a natural pain, becauſe it is deprived of good. Reaſon alone would not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to carry us to it, there muſt alſo be ſtir it up.<note place="margin">Before Sin ſenſation was no pain, but only a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe, as I have already ſaid, <hi>Adam</hi> might when he would ſtop the motion of the Animal Spirits which would cauſe pain; ſo that if he felt pain, 'twas becauſe he willed it as a good; or rather he felt it not, becauſe he would not feel it.</note> So that in all the Paſſions, all the motions of the Soul towards good, are only motions of love. But becauſe we are touched by divers Senſations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different circumſtances which accompany the proſpect of the good, and motion of the Soul towards it; we confound the Senſations with the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul, and we imagine as many different motions in the Paſſions as there are different Senſations.</p>
                        <p>Now we muſt here obſerve that Pain is a real and true Evil, and that it is no more the privation of Pleaſure, than Pleaſure is the privation of Pain; for there is a difference between not feeling Pleaſure, or being deprived of the ſenſation of it, and actually ſuffering Pain; ſo that all Evil is not ſuch preciſely, becauſe it deprives us of good; but only, as I have ſhewn, the Evil which is External, and which is not a <hi>manner of being</hi> that is in us. Nevertheleſs, as by Goods and Evils, we generally mean things Good and Evil, and not the Senſation of Pleaſure and Pain, which are rather Natural Marks whereby the Soul diſtinguiſhes Good from Evil; it ſeems that we may ſay without equivocation, that Evil is only a privation of Good, and that the Natural motion of the Soul,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107782:18"/>which drives us from Evil, is the ſame with that which inclines us to Good. For all Natural Motion being an impreſſion of the Author of Nature, who acts only for himſelf, and can only incline us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf; The true Motion of the Soul is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an eſſential love of good, and but an accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal averſion to evil.</p>
                        <p>It is, true, that Pain may be conſidered as an Evil; and in this ſenſe the Motions of the Paſſions that it excites is not real; for we do not will Pain; and if we will poſitively that Pain ſhould not be, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we would poſitively preſerve or perfect our Being.</p>
                        <p>The third thing that we may obſerve in every Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is the Senſation which accompanies them: for the Senſation of Love, Averſion, Deſire, Joy, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, are always different in different Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>The fourth is a new determination of the courſe of the Spirits and Blood towards the External parts of the Body, and towards the Internal ones: before the ſight of the Object that moves the Paſſion, the Animal Spirits were diſperſed through all the Body, to preſerve all the parts of it in general; but at the preſence of this new Object the whole Oeconomy is troubled, the greateſt paſt of the Spirits are puſhed into the Muſcles of the Arms, Legs, Face, and all the External parts of the Body, to put them in a proper diſpoſition for the Paſſion that Rules; and to give it the neceſſary poſture and motion for the acquiſition of good, or to fly the evil that preſents it ſelf; but if its own Forces are not ſufficient to anſwer its occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, theſe ſame Spirits are ſo diſtributed that they Mechanically make it utter certain words and cries, which diffuſe over the Face and the reſt of the Body ſuch an Air as is capable of agitating others with the ſame Paſſion it ſelf is moved with. For, as Men and Animals are united together by the Eyes and Ears, when any one of them is agitated, he neceſſarily moves all thoſe that look upon him and hear him, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107782:19"/>naturally makes an impreſſion upon their imagination which intereſts them in his preſervation.</p>
                        <p>As for the reſt of the Animal Spirits, they violently deſcend into the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, and the reſt of the Bowels, to demand Contributions from all thoſe parts, and haſten them in a little time to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh neceſſary Spirits to preſerve the Body in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary action it muſt be in.</p>
                        <p>The fifth is the ſenſible emotion of the Soul, which feels it ſelf agitated by the unexpected overflowing of the Spirits. This always accompanies the motion of the Spirits, ſo that it intereſts it ſelf in whatever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Body; even as the motion of the Spirits are excited in the Body as ſoon as the Soul is carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward any Object: the Soul and Body being mutually united, their motions are reciprocal.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth, are the different Senſations of Love, Averſion, Joy, Sorrow, Deſire, cauſed not by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual fight of good or evil, as thoſe we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoke of, but by the different ſhakings that the Animal Spirits cauſe in the Brain.</p>
                        <p>The ſeventh is a certain Senſation of Joy, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of inward Complacency, which ſtops the Soul in its paſſion, and aſſures it, that 'tis in the condition that is proper for it, in relation to the Object it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders. This internal Complacency generally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies all the Paſſions, thoſe which proceed from the proſpect of an Evil, as well as thoſe that proceed from the proſpect of a Good, Sorrow, as well as Joy. 'Tis this Complacency that renders all our Paſſions agreeable, and which inclines us to conſent and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our ſelves to them. In ſhort, 'tis this Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency that muſt be overcome by the delight of Grace, the joy of Faith, and Reaſon. For as the joy of the Mind always reſults from the certain or evident knowledge, that we are in the beſt eſtate we can be, in relation to the things we perceive; ſo the Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the Paſſions is a Natural Conſequence of the confuſed Senſations we have, that we are in the beſt condition we can be, in relation to the things we feel. Now by the joy of the Mind and delights of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107782:19"/>Grace we muſt conquer the falſe Complacency of our Paſſions, which makes us ſlaves to ſenſible goods.</p>
                        <p>All theſe things we have ſpoke of occur in every Paſſion, when they are excited by confuſed Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that the Mind perceives neither the good nor evil which can cauſe them, for then 'tis plain the three firſt things are not concerned in them.</p>
                        <p>We likewiſe ſee that all thoſe things are not free, that they are in us without our conſent, and even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſince the Fall; and that there is only the conſent of our Will which truly depends upon us. But it ſeems neceſſary to explain all theſe things more at large, and to render them more ſenſible by ſome Examples.</p>
                        <p>Let us ſuppoſe then that a Man has actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome affront, or that being naturally of a very lively and quick imagination, he has been agitated by ſome accident, as a diſeaſe, a melancholy retirement, or the like, and imagines to himſelf in his Cloſet, that ſuch a Perſon, who does not ſo much as think upon him, is willing and prepared to hurt him. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible proſpect or imagination of the relation which is betwixt the actions of his Enemy and his own Deſigns, will be the firſt cauſe of his Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>It is not even abſolutely neceſſary that this Man ſhould receive or imagine he received ſome affront, for the motion of his Will to receive ſome new determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: It is enough that he think it in his Mind only, without the Body's having any part in it. But as this new determination wou'd not be a determination of Paſſion, but a pure inclination very weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, we ſhou'd ſuppoſe that this Man actually ſuffers ſome great oppoſition in his deſigns, or that he ſtrongly imagines that he ſhall do ſo, rather than make another ſuppoſition wherein the Senſes and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination have little or no ſhare.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing we may conſider in the Paſſion of this Man, is an increaſe of the motion of his Will towards the good, the poſſeſſion whereof his real or imaginary Enemy would hinder him; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is ſo much the greater, as the oppoſition that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107782:20"/>would be made, appears ſtronger to him. He firſt hates his Enemy, only becauſe he loves this good, and his hatred is ſo much the greater, as his love is ſtronger; becauſe the motion of his Will in his hatred is here in effect only a motion of love, the motion of the Soul towards good, not differing from that whereby we fly the privation of it, as has been already ſaid.</p>
                        <p>The third thing is the Senſation proper to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in this it is a Senſation of Hatred; The motion of Hatred is the ſame as that of Love, but the Senſation of Hatred is quite different from that of Love, which every one may know by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Motions are actions of the Will; but Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are modifications of the Mind. The Motions of the Will are the Natural Cauſes of the Senſations of the Mind; and theſe Senſations of the Mind in their turn maintain the Motions of the Will in their determination. The Senſation of Hatred is in this Man a Natural Conſequence of the Motions of his Will, which is excited at the ſight of Evil; and this Motion is afterwards maintained by the Senſation it cauſes.</p>
                        <p>What we have ſaid of this Man, might even hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen although he ſhould have no Body. But becauſe he is compoſed of two parts naturally united, the Motions of his Mind communicate themſelves to his Body, and thoſe of his Body to his Mind. Thus the new determination, or the increaſe of the Motions of his Will, naturally produces a new determination in the Motion of the Animal Spirits, which always dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in all the Paſſions, although the Motion of the Soul be generally the ſame.</p>
                        <p>The Spirits then are forcibly puſhed into the Arms, Legs, and Face, to give the Body a diſpoſition neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Paſſion; and to diſperſe over the Face the Air a Man ought to have when we offend him, in relation to all the circumſtances of the Injury he receives, and the quality or power of him that does, and of him that ſuffers the Affront. And this diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Spirits is ſo much the ſtronger, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107782:20"/>and quicker, as the good is greater, the oppoſition ſtronger, and the Brain more ſenſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                        <p>If then the Perſon of whom we ſpeak, ſhould only receive ſome injury in his imagination, or if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a real one, but flight, and ſuch as can make no conſiderable ſhaking in the Brain, the diffuſion of the Animal Spirits will be weak and languiſhing; and perhaps inſufficient to change the common and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſpoſition of the Body. But if the injury be great, and his imagination be heated, it will cauſe a great ſhaking in his Brain, and the Spirits would he diffuſed with ſo much force, that in a moment they would create in his Body the air and geſture of the ruling Paſſion. If it is ſtrong enough to overcome, his air would be threatning and fierce. If it is weak, and cannot reſiſt the evil that oppreſſes him, his air would be humble and ſubmiſſive. His Complaints and Tears would naturally, excite in the Standers-by, and even in his Enemy, motions of Pity, and from thence they would draw the relief that could be hoped for from his own power. It is true that the Spectators and Enemy of this Miſerable Perſon, have the Spirits and Fibres of their Brain already agitated I with a violent motion, contrary to that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Compaſſion in the Soul, the Complaints of this Man would but exaſperate their Rage, and ſo his Misfortune would be inevitable, ſhould he always continue in the ſame air and geſture. But Nature has well provided in this caſe; for at the ſight of the near loſs of a great good, it naturally forms upon the Face, ſuch lively and ſurprizing Characters of Rage and Deſpair, as to diſarm the moſt Barbarous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and make them become like Statues. The terrible and unexpected fight of the Lineaments of Death drawn by the Hand of Nature upon the Face of a Miſerable Wretch, ſtops in the Enemy, who is affected with it the Motion of the Spirits and Blood which carried him to Revenge; and in that moment of favour and attention, Nature draws a-new a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſubmiſſive air upon the Face of this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107782:21"/>Man, who begins to hope becauſe of the change of his Enemy's Countenance; whoſe Animal Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a new determination they were not capable of a moment before; ſo that he Mechanically enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the motions of Compaſſion, which naturally incline his Soul to Charity and Mercy.</p>
                        <p>A Paſſionate Man cannot without a great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Spirits, either produce or preſerve in his Brain, an Image of his misfortune lively enough, or a commotion ſtrong enough, to give the Body a forced and extraordinary geſture; the Nerves, which anſwer to the inward part of his Body, receive at the ſight of any evil, the neceſſary ſhocks and agitations that cauſe the humours that are fit to produce the Spirits which the paſſion requires, to run into all the Veſſels that have communication with the heart. For the Animal Spirits being diſperſed through the Nerves which go to the Liver, Spleen, Pancreas, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to all the Bowels, they agitate and ſhake them, and by their agitation preſs forth the humors that theſe parts preſerve for the Exigencies of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine.</p>
                        <p>But if theſe humors always flowed after the ſame manner into the heart, if they there received at divers times a like fermentation, and if the Spirits, which are formed therein, equally aſcended into the Brain, we ſhou'd not ſee ſuch haſty changes in the motions of the Paſſions. The ſight of a Magiſtrate, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, wou'd not in a moment ſtop the tranſports of of a furious Man who is perſuing his revenge, and his face heated with Blood and Spirits, wou'd not all of a ſudden become pale and languid through the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſome puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>Thus to hinder theſe humors that are mixt with the Blood, from entring after the ſame manner into the Heart, there are Nerves which environ them at their paſſage, which by being contracted or dilated, by the impreſſion that the ſight of the Object, and power of the Imagination, produce in the Spirits, ſhut up, or open the way to thoſe humors. And to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame from receiving a like agitation, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107782:21"/>in the heart, at divers times; there are alſo Nerves that cauſe the Palpitations, which being not equally agitated in the different motions of the Spirits, do not puſh the Blood with the ſame force into the Arteries. Other Nerves diſperſed through the Lungs, diſtribute the Air to the heart, by contracting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the branches of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> which ſerve for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and after this manner regulate the fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, in relation to the circumſtances of the Paſſion which rules.</p>
                        <p>And, in fine, to regulate the courſe of the Spirits with the greateſt exactneſs and ſpeed, there are Nerves which environ the Arteries, as well thoſe which go to the Brain, as thoſe which conduct the Blood to all other parts of the Body. So that the ſhaking of the Brain, which accompanies the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſight of ſome Circumſtance, becauſe of which it is proper to change all the motions of the Paſſion, ſuddenly determine the courſe of the Animal Spirits to the Nerves which encompaſs theſe Arteries, that by their contraction they may ſhut up the paſſage whereby the Blood aſcends into the Brain, and by their dilating, lay open that which diſperſes it ſelf through all the other parts of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Arteries which carry the Blood to the Brain, being free, and all thoſe which diſperſe it through the reſt of the Body, being ſtrongly tied by theſe Nerves, the Head will be filled with Blood, and the Face coloured with it. But any circumſtance chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhaking of the Brain, which cauſed this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in theſe Nerves, the Arteries that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted are unlooſed, and the others on the contrary are ſtrongly contracted. Thus the Head is void of Blood, a paleneſs diffuſed over the Face, and the little Blood which goes out of the Heart, and which the Nerves, we ſpoke of, admit into it to maintain life, deſcend moſtly into the lower part of the Body; the Brain is defective of Animal Spirits, and all the reſt of the Body is ſeized with a weakneſs and trembling.</p>
                        <p>To explain, and particularly prove, what we have already ſaid, it would be neceſſary to give a general
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107782:22"/>knowledge of Phyſics, and a particular one of Human Bodies. But theſe two Sciences are alſo too imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to be treated of with all the exactneſs I could wiſh beſides, if I ſhould puſh this matter farther, it would ſoon carry me from my ſubject; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall only give a general and groſs Idea of the Paſſions, and am ſatisfied, provided this Idea be not falſe.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Shakings of the Brain, and Motions of the Blood and Spirits, are the fourth thing that is found in each of our Paſſions, and they produce the fifth, which is the ſenſible Emotion of the Soul.</p>
                        <p>In the ſame time that the Animal Spirits are puſhed from the Brain into the reſt of the Body, there to produce the Motions that's proper to maintain the Paſſion, the Soul is carried towards the good that it perceives; and that ſo much the more violently as the Spirits go out of the Brain with the more force, becauſe it is the ſame ſhaking of the Brain which acts the Soul and Animal Spirits.</p>
                        <p>The Motion of the Soul towards good is ſo much the greater, as the ſight of good is more ſenſible; and the Motion of the Spirits which proceed from the Brain to diſperſe themſelves into the reſt of the Body, is ſo much the more violent, as the ſhaking of the Fibres of the Brain, cauſed by the impreſſion of the Object or Imagination, is ſtronger; ſo this ſame ſhaking of the Brain rendring the ſight of the good more ſenſible, it is neceſſary that the Emotions of the Soul in the Paſſions ſhould augment in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the Motion of the Spirits do.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Emotions of the Soul differ not from thoſe which immediately follow the intellectual ſight of the good we have ſpoke of: They are only ſtronger and more lively becauſe of the union of the Soul and Body, and the ſenſibility of the ſight which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth thing which occurs is the Senſation of Paſſion; the Senſation of Love, Averſion, Deſire, Joy, Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Senſation is not different from that we have already ſpoke of; it is only more
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107782:22"/>quick, becauſe the Body hath a great ſhare in it. But it is always followed with a certain Senſation of Sweetneſs, which renders all our Paſſions agreeable to us, and is the laſt thing obſerved in every one of our Paſſions, as has been already ſaid.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe of this laſt Senſation is thus; At the ſight of the Object of the Paſſion, or any new Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, ſome of the Animal Spirits, are puſhed from the Head to the extream parts of the Body, to put it into the geſture the Paſſion requires; and others forcibly deſcend into the Heart, Lungs, and Bowels, from thence to draw neceſſary aſſiſtances, which has already been explained. Now it never happens that the Body is in the condition it ought to be, but the Soul receives much ſatisfaction from it; whereas if the Body is in an eſtate contrary to its good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, the Soul ſuffers much pain. Thus when we follow the Motions of our Paſſions, and ſtop not the courſe of the Spirits which the ſight of the Object of the Paſſion cauſes in our Body, to put it in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it ought to be in relation to this Object; The Soul will by the Laws of Nature receive this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of delight and inward ſatisfaction, becauſe the Body is in the ſtate it ought to be in. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when the Soul, following the Rules of Reaſon, ſtops the courſe of the Spirits, and reſiſts theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it ſuffers pain proportionably to the evil which might from thence happen to the Body.</p>
                        <p>For even as the reflexion that the Soul makes upon it ſelf, is neceſſarily accompanied with the Joy or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Mind, and afterwards with the Joy or Sorrow of the Senſes; when doing its duty, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the order of God, it would diſcover that in a proper condition, or abandoning it ſelf to its Paſſions it is touched with remorſe, which teaches it that 'tis in an ill diſpoſition. Thus the courſe of the Spirits excited by the good of the Body, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſenſible Joy or Sorrow, and afterwards with a Spiritual one, according as the courſe of the Animal spirits is hindered or favoured by the Will.</p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:107782:23"/>
                        <p>But there is this remarkable difference between the Intellectual Joy that accompanies the clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the good eſtate of the Soul, and the ſenſible Pleaſure which accompanies the confuſed Senſation of the good diſpoſition of the Body, that the Intellectual Joy is ſolid, without remorſe, and as immutable as the truth which cauſes it, whereas ſenſible Joy is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally accompanied with Sorrow of the Mind, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of Conſcience, whence it is unquiet and as inconſtant as the Paſſion or Agitation of the Blood which cauſes it: In fine, the firſt is almoſt always accompanied with a great Joy of the Senſes, when it is a conſequence of the knowledge of a great good, that the Soul poſſeſſes; and the other is ſeldom accompanied with any Joy of the Mind, although it be a conſequence of a great good which only happens to the Body, if it is contrary to the good of the Soul.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore true, that without the Grace of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> the ſatisfaction the Soul taſtes in abandoning it ſelf to its Paſſions, is more agreeable than that it feels in following the Rules of Reaſon; and it is this Satisfaction which is the cauſe of all the Diſorders that have followed Original Sin, and it would make us all Slaves to our Paſſions, if the Son of God did not deliver us from their ſervitude, by the delights of his Grace; For indeed what I have ſaid on the behalf of the Joy of the Mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Joy of the Senſes, is only true amongſt Chriſtians; and was abſolutely falſe in the Mouth of <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and in ſhort, of all the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers who appeared the moſt reaſonable; becauſe the Yoke of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> is only ſweet to thoſe that belong to him, and his Burthen only ſeems light to us, when his Grace ſupports us under it.</p>

                        <p>WHatſoever we have already in general explained about the qualities and effect of the Paſſions, ſhews them not to be free, they take up their reſidence in our Breaſts without our leave, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the conſent of our Will which abſolutely depends upon us. The proſpect of Good is naturally followed with a Motion and Senſation of Love, a Shaking of the Brain, and Motion of the Spirits, a new Emotion of the Soul which increaſes the firſt Motion of Love, and a new Senſation of the Soul which augments the firſt Senſation of Love, and, in fine, a Senſation of Complacency which recompences the Soul for the Bodies being in a ſtate convenient for it. All theſe things paſs in the Soul and Body Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and Mechanically; that is, without their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any part in it, ſince our conſent only truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon us. This Conſent muſt alſo be regulated, preſerved, and kept free, notwithſtanding all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of our Paſſions to the contrary. 'Tis to God alone that it muſt ſubmit its liberty, yielding only to the Voice of the Author of Nature, Internal Evidence, and to the ſecret reproaches of Reaſon. We ſhould never conſent, but when we clearly ſee we ſhould make an ill uſe of our liberty if we refuſed it: And this is the chief Rule that muſt be obſerved to avoid Error.</p>
                        <p>'Tis God only who evidently ſhews us, that we muſt ſubmit to what ever he requires; to him alone therefore we muſt wholly devote our ſelves. There is no Evidence in the Alurements and Careſſes; the Frights and Menaces we receive from our Paſſions:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107782:24"/>They are only confuſed and obſcure Senſations to which we muſt never give ear. We muſt ſtay till theſe falſe lights of the Paſſions are diſſipated, and wait for a purer light to guide us, till God himſelf ſpeaks to us. We muſt enter into our ſelves, and there enquire for him that never leaves us, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually inſtructs us, He ſpeaks low, but his Voice is diſtinct; he illuminates but little, yet his light is pure; Rather his Voice is as ſtrong as 'tis diſtinct, and his Light as bright and active as 'tis pure. But our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions keep us always out of our ſelves, and by their noiſe and darkneſs hinder us from being inſtructed by his Voice, and illuminated by his Light. He even ſpeaks to thoſe who ask nothing of him, and thoſe whoſe Paſſions have put them at the greateſt diſtance from him, do nevertheleſs now and then hear ſome of his Words; But they are ſuch Words as are ſtrong, threatning and terrible; and pierce more than a two edged Sword, which penetrates the moſt ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the Soul, and diſcerns the thoughts and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Heart:<note place="margin">

We ought therefore to enter into our ſelves, to approach near him; to deſire him to inform us of what we would know, to hearken to and obey him: For if we always give ear to him, we ſhould never be deceiv'd; and by continually Obeying him, we ſhould free our ſelves from the miſeries and inconſtancies of our Paſſions, to which Sin has ſubjected us.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not think with ſome pretended Wits, whom the pride of their Paſſions have reduced to the condition of Beaſts, and who having ſo long contemned the Law of God, ſeem at laſt to know no other than that of their infamous Paſſions: We ought not, I ſay, like thoſe Men that are guided merely by Fleſh and Blood, to imagine that in following the motions of our Paſſions, and ſecret deſires of our own Hearts, we ſhou'd follow God, and obey the voice of the Author of Nature; for this would be the utmoſt blindneſs; and according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                        <p>Their Arguments however want not probability, and ſeeming very agreeable to common Senſe; they are favoured by the Paſſions, and could never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by all the Philoſophy of <hi>Zeno.</hi> We muſt love good, ſay they, and pleaſure is the character that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has, united to it; and by this character we can never be deceived, ſince it proceeds from God, who has affixed it thereto that we might diſtinguiſh it from evil. We muſt alſo fly evil, continue they, and pain is the character that Nature has united to that, nor can we be deceiv'd by it, ſince God has inſtituted it, that thereby we might diſcern it from good. We taſte Pleaſure when we abandon our ſelves to our Paſſions; and feel Pain and Bitterneſs in reſiſting them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Author of Nature would have us give up our ſelves to our Paſſions, and never reſiſt them; ſince the Pleaſure and Pain he makes us feel in theſe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are certain proofs of his Will in reſpect to them, To follow God therefore is to perſue the deſires of our own Hearts, and to obey him, is to conform our ſelves to the inſtinct of Nature, which enclines us to ſatisfie our Senſes and Paſſions. After this manner they confirm themſelves in their impious Opinions, and by this means endeavour to ſtifle the ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of their Reaſon, and for the puniſhment of their Crimes, God permits them to be dazled with theſe falſe lights, which blind inſtead of enlightning them, but with ſuch a blindneſs, as they are, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, and wiſh not to be delivered from. God gives them over to a reprobate Senſe, abandons them to the deſires of their Hearts, to ſhameful Paſſions, and Actions unworthy of Man, as the Scripture tells us, that after being as it were <hi>fatned</hi> by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches, they may to all Eternity become the victims of his Wrath.</p>

                        <p>But we will ſolve the difficulty they propoſe, which the Sect of <hi>Zeno</hi> not being able to do, have denied that Pleaſure was good, or Pain an evil. But this was too raſh an attempt, and unbecoming Philoſophers, and I dont believe it ever made thoſe change their Opinion, who experimentally found that a great Pain was a great Miſery. Since therefore <hi>Zeno</hi> and all the Heathen Philoſophy could not reſolve this difficulty, offered by the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> therefore we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a more ſolid and enlightened Philoſophy.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, that Pleaſure is good, and Pain an evil; and that Pleaſure and Pain by the Author of Nature have been affixed to the uſe of certain things, to make us capable of judging whether they are good or bad: That we muſt chooſe the good, fly the evil, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally follow the motions of our Paſſions. All this is true, but it only relates to the Body, to preſerve which, and long to continue a Life like to that of Beaſts, we muſt ſuffer our ſelves to be governed by our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions and Deſires. The Senſes and Paſſions were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given us for the good of the Body; ſenſible Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is the character which Nature has joined to the uſe of certain things, that without taking the pains to examine them by Reaſon, we might employ 'em for the preſervation of the Body; but not that we ſhould love them; for we ought to love nothing but what Reaſon moſt certainly diſcovers to us to be our good.</p>
                        <p>We are Rational Beings, and God who is our chief Good, requires not of us, a blind Love, a Love of Inſtinct, or one that is forced; but a Love of Choice, of Knowledge, and ſuch a one as ſubjects our Mind and Hearts to him. He induces us to love him by diſcovering to us by the light that accompanies the delection of his Grace, that he is our Soveraign Good: but inclines us to the good of the Body only by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and a confuſed ſenſation of Pleaſure, becauſe the good of the Body deſerves neither the application of the Mind, nor exerciſe of our Reaſon.</p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107782:25"/>
                        <p>But farther, our Body is not our ſelves; 'tis ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that belongs to us, without which abſolutely ſpeaking, we may exiſt: The Good of the Body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not properly our good, for Bodies can be only the good of Bodies, which we may make uſe of for the good of our Body, but we muſt not unite our ſelves to them. Our Soul has likewiſe a Good pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to her ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that good only that is ſuperiour to her, who alone preſerves, and produces in her the ſenſations of Pain and Pleaſure. For in fine, all the objects of our Senſes are of themſelves uncapable of making us perceive them, and 'tis God alone that can teach us they are preſent, by the ſenſation he gives us of them, which is a Truth the Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers could never comprehend.</p>
                        <p>We may, and I confeſs ought to love what is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making us feel Pleaſure. And 'tis for that reaſon we muſt love none but God, becauſe 'tis only he who can act in our Souls, ſince ſenſible objects can only move the Organs of our Senſes. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be anſwered by ſome, what matters it from whence theſe agreeable Senſations come, we will enjoy them? Ingrateful as they are, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the hand that ſo kindly beſtows theſe Goods. They would have a juſt God give unjuſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and recompense them for the Crimes they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit againſt him, at the very time they commit them: They would make uſe of his immutable Will, which is the Order and Law of Nature, to force undeſerved favours from him. For by a criminal Artifice they produce ſuch motions in their Bodies which obliges him to make them taſte all ſorts of Pleaſures. But Death will corrupt this Body, and God whom they have made ſubſervient to their unjuſt Deſires, will make them ſubmit to his juſt Anger, and will mock them in his turn.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, 'tis a very hard thing that the poſſeſſion of the Goods of the Body ſhould be attended with Pleaſure, and that that of the Goods of the Soul ſhould often be tied to Pain and Sorrow. We may look upon it as a great irregularity, becauſe Pleaſure
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107782:26"/>being the character of Good, as Pain is that of Evil, we ought infinitely to take more delight in the love of God than in the uſe of ſenſible things, ſince God is the true, or rather the only Good of the Mind. This will certainly happen one day, and 'tis very probable 'twas ſo before the Fall; at leaſt 'tis certain before Sin entered into the World we felt no pain in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our Duty.</p>
                        <p>But God has withdrawn himſelf from us ever ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> he is no longer our Good by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only by Grace; for now we naturally find no ſatisfaction in loving him, and he rather diverts us from, then enclines us to love him: If we follow him he repulſes us, if we run after him he ſmites us; if we are conſtant in our perſuit, he ſtill treats us ill, and makes us ſuffer very lively and ſenſible Griefs. But when being weary with walking in the hard and painful Paths of Virtue, without being incouraged by the reliſh of Good, or aſſiſted by any Nouriſhment, we begin to feed upon ſenſible things, to which he unites us by the taſte of Pleaſure, as if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us for turning aſide from him to follow thoſe periſhing Goods. In ſhort, ſince the firſt Sin, it ſeems as if God were not pleaſed that we ſhould love or think upon him, or that we ſhould look upon him as our only and chief Good. It is only through the Grace of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> that we are now ſenſible that God is our Good; ſince 'tis by his Grace that we take any pleaſure and ſatisfaction in the love of God.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Soul neither diſcovering her own Good by a clear view, or by ſenſation, without the Grace of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> ſhe takes the Good of the Body for her own: She loves it, and is more ſtrictly united to it, by her Will, than ſhe was by the firſt Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature. For the Good of the Body being the only one left that we are now ſenſible of, it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily acts the more powerfully upon Man, affects his Brain more livelily, and conſequently the Soul muſt feel and imagine it after a more ſenſible manner. And the Animal Spirits being more violently agitated, the Will muſt needs love it with more Ardour and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:107782:26"/>
                        <p>Before Sin the Soul was able to efface out of the Brain an over lively image of ſenſible good, and cauſe the pleaſure that attended this image to vaniſh. The Body being thus ſubmitted to the Mind, the Soul could in an inſtant put a ſtop to the ſhaking of the Fibres of the Brain, and emotion of the Spirits, only by the conſideration of its Duty. But now it remains no longer in its power, nor do theſe traces of the Imagination, and motions of the Spirits, any longer depend upon it; and therefore by a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, Pleaſure, which by the order of Nature is affixed to theſe traces and motions, is become the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maſter of the Heart. Man cannot long reſiſt this Pleaſure by his own ſtrength, 'tis Grace only that can entirely overcome it; becauſe none but God, as the Author of Grace, can overcome himſelf as the Author of Nature, or rather can appeaſe himſelf as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſobedience.</p>

                           <note place="margin">See the Fifth Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the <hi>Chriſtian Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end.</note>The <hi>Stoics,</hi> who had but a confuſed knowledge of the diſorders of original Sin, could not confute the <hi>Epicureans;</hi> their happineſs being but barely Ideal, ſince there is no felicity without Pleaſure; and they could not reliſh Pleaſure in the meer perſuit of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions: 'tis true, they might find ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in following the Rules of their imaginary Virtue, becauſe it is a natural conſequence of the knowledge our Soul has, that ſhe's in the moſt eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition ſhe can be in. This joy of the Mind might maintain their Reſolutions for ſome time, but it was not ſtrong enough to reſiſt Pain and conquer Pleaſure. 'Twas ſecret Pride, and not Joy, that made them keep their Countenance; for when no one was preſent they ſoon loſt all their Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, like Kings upon the Theatre, whoſe Grandeur vaniſhes in a moment.</p>
                        <p>It is very different with thoſe Chriſtians who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly follow the Rules of the Goſpel. Their Joy is ſolid, becauſe they moſt certainly know they are in the happieſt condition they can poſſibly be at preſent: Their Joy is alſo great, becauſe the Good they taſte through Faith and Hope is infinite. For the Hope of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107782:27"/>a great Good is always attended with a ſenſible Joy; and this Joy is ſo much the more vigorous, as the Hope is ſtronger; becauſe a ſtrong Hope repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Good as preſent, neceſſarily produces that Joy, and ſenſible Pleaſure which always accompanies the preſence of Good. Nor is their Joy uneaſie, becauſe it is founded upon the promiſes of God, by the Blood of whoſe Son it is confirmed, and maintain'd by the inward Peace, and inexpreſſible ſweetneſs of Charity, which the Holy Ghoſt diffuſes in their Hearts. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſeparate them from the true Good, when they taſte and are pleaſed with it through the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Grace. The Pleaſures of Corporeal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are not ſo great, as thoſe they feel in the love of God; rather than quit them they chooſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Pain, they are not affrighted at Reproaches and Diſgrace, and the Pleaſures they find in their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or to ſpeak more properly, thoſe they meet with in God, when they contemn every thing to be united to him, are ſo violent that they tranſport them, and makes them ſpeak a new Language, and with the Apoſtles, boaſt of the Miſeries and Injuries they ſuffer. The Scripture tells us, That when the Apoſtles <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Council, they were filled with Joy that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the Name of</hi> JESUS. And this is the diſpoſition of Mind in true Chriſtians, when they have received the greateſt Affronts for defending the Truth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> being come to reeſtabliſh that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Sin had overthrown, and Order requiring that the greateſt Goods ſhould be accompanied with the moſt ſolid Pleaſures; it is plain that things ought to happen after the manner we have related, But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Reaſon, Experience confirms it; for a Perſon no ſooner takes a reſolution of contemning every thing for God, but he is commonly ſo affected with a Pleaſure, or inward Joy, that he as ſenſibly feels God to be his Good, as before he evidently knew him to be ſo.</p>
                        <p>True Chriſtians aſſure us every day, that the Joy they have in the Love and Service of God is inexpreſſible; and 'tis very reaſonable to believe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107782:27"/>them concerning what paſſes in themſelves. The wicked on the contrary are perpetually tormented with mortal Diſquiets; and ſuch as are divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the World, partake alſo of the Joys of the Righteous, and Diſſatisfactions of the Wicked; They complain of their Miſeries, and 'tis likewiſe juſt to believe their Complaints are not groundleſs. God ſtrikes Men to the very quick, when they make choice of any other object for their chief Good but himſelf, and 'tis this wound that makes them really miſerable: But fills the Mind of thoſe with exceſſive Joy, who only unite themſelves to him; and 'tis this Joy which gives the true Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The abundance of Riches and poſſeſſion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Dignities being external, cannot cure the wound God makes. And as Poverty and Contempt are alſo without us, ſo they cannot hurt us when the Almighty protects us.</p>
                        <p>It is evident by what has been ſaid, that the objects of our Paſſions are not our Good, and that we muſt only follow their Motions for the preſervation of our Lives: That ſenſible Pleaſure in reſpect of our Good, is what our Senſations are in relation to the Truth; and even as we find our Senſes deceive us in matters of Truth, ſo our Paſſions deceive us concerning our Good: That we muſt ſubmit to the Delectation of Grace, becauſe it evidently enclines us to love the true Good; nor is followed with the ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Reaſon, like the blind inſtinct and confuſed pleaſure of the Paſſions; but is always attended with a ſecret Joy agreeable to the condition we are in: And laſt of all, ſince God only can act upon our Mind, we can find no Felicity out of God; except we would ſuppoſe that God rewards none but the Diſobedient, or Commands us to love that <hi>moſt</hi> which <hi>leaſt</hi> deſerves our love.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That the Perfection of the Mind conſiſts in its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God, by the knowledge of Truth and love of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; And that on the contrary, its Imperfection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds only from its dependance on the Body, becauſe of the diſorder of its Senſes and Paſſions.</head>
                        <p>THE leaſt reflexion is enough to diſcover to us, that the good of the Mind muſt neceſſarily be ſomething Spiritual; for Bodies are much inferior to the Mind, and cannot act upon it by their own ſtrength: They are not able immediately to unite themſelves to it, nor are they intelligible of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and therefore cannot be its good. On the contrary, Spiritual Things are intelligible from their own Nature, and may unite themſelves to the Mind; conſequently be its good, if we ſuppoſe them ſuperior to it; for that a thing may be the good of the Mind, it is not enough to be Spiritual like that, it muſt be above it, that it may be able to act upon it, inſtruct and recompence it; otherwiſe it cou'd neither make it more happy nor more perfect, and therefore cou'd not be its good. Of all things both Intelligible and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, there is none but God that is thus ſuperior to the Mind; from whence it follows, that nothing but he is, or can be its true good, nor can we therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more perfect or more happy, but in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
                        <p>Every one is convinced, that the knowledge of the Truth, and love of Virtue, makes the Mind more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and that the blindneſs of the Mind, and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the Inclinations, renders it more imperfect. The knowledge of Truth, and love of Virtue then, can be nothing elſe but the union of the Mind with God, and even a kind of poſſeſſing of him: And the blindneſs of the Mind, and irregularity of the Heart, can likewiſe be nothing elſe but the ſeparation of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107782:28"/>Mind from God, and the uniting the Mind to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferior to it, like the Body, ſince only this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can make it imperfect and unhappy. Thus to be acquainted with Truth, to know things that are the moſt agreeable, or conſonant to the Rules of Virtue, is to know God himſelf.</p>
                        <p>The Mind is, as it were, placed between God and the Body, Good and Evil; between what inſtructs and blinds it, regulates and diſorders it, what can make it perfect and happy, and what can make it imperfect and miſerable. When it diſcovers any Truth, or ſees things as they are in themſelves, it ſees them in the Idea's of God; that is, by a clear and diſtinct view of what it is in God that repreſents them. For as I have before intimated, the Mind of Man does not, in it ſelf, include the Perfections or Idea's, of all the Beings it is capable of conſidering: 'Tis not the Univerſal Being, and therefore does not ſee in it ſelf ſuch things as are diſtinct from it; by conſulting it ſelf, it is neither capable of enlightening or inſtructing it ſelf, for 'tis neither its own Perfection nor Light; it ſtands in need of the immenſe Light of Truth by which it is united to, and poſſeſſes God in ſome manner.</p>
                        <p>But we cannot only ſay, that the Mind, which is acquainted with Truth, does in ſome manner know God who includes it, but we may likewiſe add, That in part it knows things as God himſelf knows them; for the Mind knows their true Relations, and God knows them alſo; the Mind diſcovers them by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perfections of God who repreſents them, God ſees them likewiſe by the ſame means. For in ſhort, God neither ſees nor imagines, but perceives in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he is the Intellectual World, the Material and Senſible one which he has created. It is the ſame with the Mind in its knowledge of Truth, it perceives it not by Senſation and Imagination: Senſations and Phantoms, only repreſent falſe Relations to the Mind; and whoever diſcovers the Truth, can only ſee it in the Intellectual World to which 'tis united, and in which God himſelf ſees it; for this Material and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World, is not intelligible of it ſelf. The Mind
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107782:29"/>then ſees in the Light of God what e'er it ſees clearly; thô it ſees them but imperfectly, and in that reſpect very differently from what God ſees them. So that when the Mind diſcovers the Truth, it is not only united to God, but poſſeſſes, and beholds him; and in one ſenſe, ſees the Truth as God himſelf does.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe, when our Love is regulated by Virtue, we love God; for when we love according to theſe Rules, the impreſſion of love that God continually produces in our hearts inclines us towards him, and is neither diverted by Free-will, nor changed into Self-love. The Mind then does only, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt freedom, follow this impreſſion that God gives it; and the Almighty never giving it any impreſſion but what tends towards him, ſince he only acts for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: It is evident, that when we love according to the Rules of Virtue, we love God.</p>
                        <p>But 'tis not only to love God, 'tis alſo to love as God does; who only loves himſelf, and his Works, becauſe they relate to his Perfections, and loves theſe Works proportionably to the relation they have to theſe Perfections: And indeed, 'tis the ſame love whereby God loves himſelf, and whatever he has created. To love according to the Rules of Virtue, is to love God only; and to love God in every thing, is to love every thing ſo far as it partakes of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Perfection, ſince that is to love them in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their Amiableneſs. In ſhort, 'tis to love by the impreſſion of the ſame love whereby God loves himſelf; for 'tis that love by which God loves himſelf, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever relates to him, which animates us, when we love as we ought to do: And therefore we then love as God loves.</p>
                        <p>It is then evident, that the knowledge of Truth, and regulated love of Virtue, produces all our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſince they are commonly the conſequences of our Union with God, and even lead us to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, as much as we are capable in this life. And on the contrary, the blindneſs of our Minds, and irregularity of our Inclinations, are the cauſe of all our imperfections, being the Natural effects of the union of our Mind with our Body, as I have before proved, in ſhewing that we never diſcover the Truth,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107782:29"/>nor love the true Good, when we follow the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of our Senſes, Imaginations and Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>Tho' theſe things are ſo evident, yet Men, who ardently, deſire to perfect their Being, take very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pains to encreaſe their union with God, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually endeavour to ſtrengthen and enlarge that they have with Senſible things. The cauſe of this ſtrange irregularity cannot be too fully explain'd.</p>
                        <p>The poſſeſſion of Good muſt naturally produce theſe two effects in him that enjoys it; it makes him more perfect, and at the ſame time more happy: Yet it does not always happen ſo; I confeſs, 'tis impoſſible that the Mind ſhou'd actually poſſeſs any good, and not be actually more perfect, but it may actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a good, without being made more happy by it. Thoſe who are beſt acquainted with the Truth, and have the greateſt love for the moſt amiable good, are always actually more perfect than thoſe that are ſtill ſubjected to blindneſs and diſorder, yet are they not always actually more happy. It is the ſame thing in reſpect to Evil, it makes men both imperfect and unhappy at the ſame times; yet tho' it always renders them more imperfect, it does not always make them more unhappy; or, at leaſt, it does not make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in proportion to the imperfection it gives them. Virtue is often unpleaſant and bitter, and Vice ſweet and agreeable; ſo that 'tis chiefly through Faith and Hope, that good Men are truly happy, whilſt the Wicked actually enjoy Pleaſure and Delights. It ought not to be thus 'tis true; but ſo it is, Sin having cauſed this diſorder, as I have ſhew'd in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chapter; and 'tis this diſorder that is the chief cauſe, not only of all the irregularities of our Hearts, but alſo of the blindneſs and ignorance of our Minds.</p>
                        <p>Our Imagination is by this diſorder perſwaded, that the Body may be the <hi>good</hi> of the Mind; for Pleaſure, as I have many times intimated, is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, or Senſible Mark of Good; and the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Earthly enjoyments, are thoſe which we imagine we receive from the Body. Wherefore, without much reflexion, we judge that Bodies may be, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107782:30"/>even truly are our <hi>Good:</hi> And 'tis ſo difficult to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Inſtinct of Nature, and to reſiſt the Proofs of Senſation, that we never ſo much as think of it. We reflect not upon the diſorders that Sin has produced, and conſider not that Bodies can only act upon the Mind as occaſional Cauſes; That the Mind cannot immediately, or of it ſelf, enjoy any corporeal thing; and that it can unite it ſelf to no object but by its knowledge and love: God only being above us, can recompence or puniſh us with Senſations of Pleaſure, or Pain, which can inſtruct more; and, in ſhort, act in us. Theſe truths, altho' very evident to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Minds, are not ſo powerful to convince us, as the deceitful Experience of a ſenſible impreſſion.</p>
                        <p>When we conſider any thing as part of our ſelves, or look upon our ſelves as part of this thing which we judge is good for us to be united to, we have a love for it; and this love is ſo much the greater, as the thing which we take to be united to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appears a more conſiderable part of the whole which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with it. Now there are two ſorts of Proofs which perſwade us that a thing is part of our ſelves; the inſtinct of Senſation, and evidence of Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>By the inſtinct of Senſation, I am perſwaded that my Soul is united to my Body, or that my Body makes up part of my Being; yet I have no full evidence of it, ſince 'tis not by the light of Reaſon that I conclude it, but by the Pain or Pleaſure I feel when Objects ſtrike my Senſes. If I prick my hand I ſuffer pain, therefore I conclude my hand to be a part of my Self; but if my Cloaths are torn I ſuffer nothing, therefore determine they do not belong to my Being. My Hair is cut without pain, but cannot be pluck'd off without it: This perplexes the Philoſophers, and they know not how to decide it, but their indetermination ſhews the wiſeſt Judge, rather by the inſtinct of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation than light of Reaſon, that ſuch things are, or are not a part of themſelves: For if they concluded from Evidence and Reaſon, they wou'd ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that the Mind and Body are Beings of different Species, and that the Mind cannot be united to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107782:30"/>Body of it ſelf; that 'tis only through the union we have with God, that the Soul is wounded when the Body is ſtruck. Therefore 'tis only by the inſtinct of Senſation that we look upon our Bodies, and all the ſenſible things we are united to, as parts of our ſelves; I mean, as part of what thinks and feels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, becauſe what is not, cannot be diſcover'd by the evidence of Reaſon, ſince evidence diſcovers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Truth.</p>
                        <p>And on the contrary, 'tis by the light of Reaſon that we diſcover the relation we have with intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things; By a clear view of the Mind, we diſcover that we are united to God after a more ſtrict and eſſential manner than we are to our Bodies; That without him we are nothing; can neither do, nor know, will, nor feel any thing; That he is our <hi>All,</hi> and if we may ſo ſpeak, that we make but one whole with him, whereof we are an infinitely ſmall part. The light of Reaſon diſcovers a thouſand Motives to us, that wou'd induce us to love God only, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the Body as unworthy of our love; but we are hot naturally ſenſible of our union with God, nor by the inſtinct of Senſation, but only through the Grace of our <hi>SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> perſwaded that he is our All; which Grace cauſes ſuch a Spiritual Senſation in ſome Perſons, as it aſſiſts them in conquering that contrary Senſation which unites them to the Body. For God, as he is the Author of Nature, inclines our Minds to love him, by an enlightened knowledge, and not one of inſtinct: And very probable 'tis, ſince the Fall, that he, as Author of Grace, has added Inſtinct to Illumination, becauſe our light is now ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, that it is incapable of carrying us to God; beſides its being continually weakened, and made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual by contrary Pleaſure and Inſtinct.</p>
                        <p>We, by the light of the Mind, then diſcover, that we are united both to God, and the Intellectual World he includes; and by Senſation are convinced, that we are united to our Bodies, and by them to the Material and Senſible World, which God has created. But as our Senſations are more lively, moving, frequent,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107782:31"/>and even more laſting than our Illuminations, ſo we cannot think it ſtrange that our Senſations ſhou'd agitate us, and ſtir up our love to all Senſible Things, and that our light diſſipates and vaniſhes without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in us any Zeal for the Truth.</p>
                        <p>It is true, there are many Men who are perſwaded that God is their true Good, love him as their All, and who ardently deſire to encreaſe and ſtrengthen the union they have with him; but few evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that to know and conſider the Truth, is to unite themſelves to God with all their Natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; that 'tis a kind of enjoying of him, to meditate on the true Idea's of things; and that this abſtracted view of certain, general, and immutable Truths, which determine all particular ones, are the flights of a Mind which quits the Body to be united to God. Metaphyſics, Speculative Mathematics, and all Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Sciences, which regulate and include particular ones, as the Univerſal Being comprehends all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Beings, ſeem Chimerical to moſt Men, even to the Religious, as well as to thoſe who do not love God: So that I dare hardly ſay, that by enquiring into theſe Sciences, the Mind applies it ſelf to God, after the moſt pure and perfect manner it is naturally capable of; and that 'tis by a proſpect of the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual World, which is the Object of theſe Sciences, that God has created, and ſtill knows this Senſible World; from whence Bodies receive their life, as Spirits live from the other.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who only follow the impreſſion of their Senſes and Motions of their Paſſions, are incapable of reliſhing truth becauſe it does not flatter them. And good Men who continually oppoſe their Paſſions when they preſent falſe goods to them, do not always reſiſt them, when they obſcure the truth, or make it contemptible to them; becauſe Perſons may be Pious without extraordinary Judgments. To make us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, 'tis not requiſite for us exactly to know that our Senſes, Imaginations, and Paſſions, always repreſent things otherwiſe to us than they are; for indeed it does not appear that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:107782:31"/>or his Apoſtles deſigned to undeceive us of ſeveral Errors that <hi>D'cartes</hi> has ſince diſcovered to us upon this matter.</p>
                        <p>There is a great deal of difference between Faith and Knowledge, the Goſpel and Philoſophy; The moſt ignorant are capable of Faith, but few are able to underſtand Evident Truths. Faith repreſents God as the Creator of Heaven and Earth, to the moſt Simple, which is enough to induce them to love and ſerve him: but Reaſon conſiders God not only in his Works, becauſe ſhe knows he exiſted before he was a Creator, and therefore endeavours to Contemplate him in himſelf, or in the great and vaſt Idea of an infinitely perfect Being which is included in him. The Son of God, who is the Wiſdom of the Father, or the Eternal Truth, was made Man, and became ſenſible to diſcover himſelf to the carnal and moſt ignorant: That he might inſtruct them by that which cauſed their blindneſs, and encline them to love him, and looſe them from ſenſible Objects, by the ſame things that had captivated them. For when he had to do with Fools, he made uſe of a kind of ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to make them wiſe; ſo that the moſt Religious and Faithful have not always the greateſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. They may know God by Faith, and love him through the aſſiſtance of his Grace, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning him to be their All, after the ſame manner as Philoſophers do, and without reflecting that the abſtracted knowledge of Truth is a kind of union with him. We muſt not therefore be ſurprized, if there are but few Perſons who endeavour to ſtrengthen their Natural Union they have with God, by ſeeking after the Truth; ſince to this end it would be neceſſary conſtantly to oppoſe the impreſſion of the Senſes and Paſſions after a very different manner from that which is familiar to the moſt Virtuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for moſt good Men are not always perſwaded that the Senſes and Paſſions deceive us after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we have explained in the precedent Books.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Senſations and Thoughts, wherein the Body has any ſhare, are the true and immediate cauſe of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107782:32"/>our Paſſions; becauſe 'tis only the ſhaking of the Fibres of the Brain that excites any particular emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Animal Spirits; ſo that only our Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can ſenſibly convince us that we depend on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things, which they excite us to love: But we feel not the Natural Union we have with God, when we diſcover the Truth; nor ſo much as think upon him, for he is within us, and operates after ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and inſenſible manner that we perceive him not: Our Natural Union with him therefore does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to love him; But our Union with Senſible Things is quite different; All our Senſations declare this Union, and Bodies preſent themſelves to our Eyes when they act in us, nor is any thing they do concealed. Even our own Body is more preſent to us than our Mind, and we conſider it as the beſt part of our ſelves. Thus the Union we have with our Body, and through that, with all ſenſible Objects, excites a violent love in us, which increaſes this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and makes us depend upon things that are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely below us.</p>

                        <p>IT's the part of Moral Philoſophy to enquire into all the particular Errors wherein our Paſſions engage us concerning good; to oppoſe the irregularities of Love, to eſtabliſh the ſincerity of the Heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Manners. But our chief intent here is to give Rules for the Mind, and to diſcover the cauſes of our Errors in reſpect of Truth; ſo that we ſhall purſue no further, thoſe things already mentioned, which relate only to the love of the true Good: We will then proceed to the Mind, but ſhall not paſs by tne Heart, becauſe it has the greateſt influence over the Mind: We will enquire after the Truth in it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107782:32"/>ſelf, and without thinking on the relation it has to us, only ſo far as this relation is the occaſion that Self-love diſguiſes and conceals it from us: for we judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things according to our Paſſions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves in all things; the Judgments of the Paſſions never agreeing with the Judgments of the Truth.</p>
                        <p>'Tis what we may learn from theſe admirable words of St. <hi>Bernard:</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Our Love, Hatred, and Fear, cauſe us to make falſe Judgments only; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the pure Light of Truth, can enlighten our Mind. 'Tis only the diſtinct Voice of our common Maſter that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us to make ſolid Judgments, and he will infallibly do it, provided we only judge of what he ſays, and according to what he ſays, <hi>Sicut audio, ſic judico, As I hear I judge.</hi> But let us ſee after what manner our Paſſions ſeduce us, that we may the more eaſily reſiſt them.</p>
                        <p>The Paſſions have ſo great a relation to the Senſes, that 'twill not be difficult to diſcover after what manner they engage us in Error, if we but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what has been ſaid in the Firſt Book. For the general Cauſes of the Errors of our Paſſions are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely like thoſe of the Errors of our Senſes.</p>
                        <p>The moſt general cauſe of the Errors of our Senſes is, as we have ſhewn in the Firſt Book, our attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Body, or to External Objects, thoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107782:33"/>which belong to our Soul; affixing Colours to the Surfaces of Bodies; diffuſing of Light, Sounds, Odours in the Air; and aſſigning Pain and Pleaſure to thoſe parts of our Body which receive any change by the motion of other Bodies which meet them.</p>
                        <p>The ſame thing may be ſaid of our Paſſions: we imprudently attribute to thoſe Objects which cauſe, or ſeem to cauſe them, all the diſpoſitions of our Heart; Goodneſs, Meekneſs, Malice, Ill-nature, and all the other Qualities of our Mind. Whatever Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject produces any Paſſion in us; in ſome manner ſeems to include in it ſelf, what it ſtirs up in us, when we think upon it: Even as ſenſible Objects appear to us to include the Senſations their preſence excites. When we love any Perſon, we are naturally inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they love us, and 'twould be difficult for us to imagine that they had either any deſign to hurt us, or to oppoſe our deſires. But if hatred ſucceeds love, we cannot believe that they deſign us any good; we interpret all their actions in the worſt ſenſe, and are always ſuſpicious and upon our guard, although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they think not of us, or elſe intend to do us ſome ſervice. In ſhort, we unjuſtly attribute all the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of our Heart, to thoſe Perſons who excite any Paſſion in us; even as we imprudently aſcribe all the qualities of our Mind to ſenſible Objects.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, by the ſame reaſon that we believe all Men receive the ſame Senſations of the ſame Objects as we do, we think that all Men are acted with the ſame Paſſions as we are upon the ſame ſubjects, provided we believe they are capable of being moved by them. We imagine they love, what we love, or deſire what we deſire: from whence proceed Jealouſies and ſecret Averſions, if the good we are in purſuit of cannot be wholly poſſeſſed by many: but if ſeveral Perſons can poſſeſs it without dividing it, as they may the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Good, Science, Vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then 'tis quite of another matter. We likewiſe think they hate, ſhun, and fear the ſame things as we do, and from thence comes Aſſociations and ſecret Conſpiracies according to the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107782:33"/>nature of the thing we hate, by this means hoping to deliver our ſelves from our Miſeries.</p>
                        <p>We attribute therefore the Emotions of our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to thoſe Objects that produce them in us, and believe that all other Men, and even ſometimes that Beaſts are agitated like us; beſides, we judge yet more raſhly, that the cauſe of our Paſſion, which is often only imaginary, is really in ſome Object.</p>
                        <p>When we have a Paſſionate Love for any one, we think every thing is amiable in them : His Grimaces are Charming, his Uglineſs is not diſpleaſing; his Irregular Motions and Unhandſom Geſtures are Juſt, or at leaſt Natural. If he never ſpeaks, 'tis becauſe he is Wiſe; if he talks much, he is very Witty; if he ſpeaks upon every thing, his Knowledge is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal; if he continually interrupts others, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from his Quickneſs, Vicacity, and Fire: In ſhort, if he would be chief in all Company, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he Merits it. Thus our Paſſion after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hides or diſguiſes the Defects of our Friends, and on the contrary magnifies the leaſt good Quality in them.</p>
                        <p>But if this Love is only founded upon the agitation of the Blood and Animal Spirits like the reſt of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in time it cools for want of heat, or proper Spirits to maintain it; and if intereſt or any other falſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion change the diſpoſition of the Brain, hatred will ſucceed this love, and will not fail to make us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in the Object of our Paſſion, all the defects that can cauſe a juſt Averſion. In the ſame Perſon we ſhall ſee ſuch Qualities as are directly contrary to what we admired before; and be aſhamed that ever we loved them; and the Predominant Paſſion will be ſure to juſtifie it ſelf, and make that it ſucceeds ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
                        <p>The power and injuſtice of the Paſſions are not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to what we have already ſaid, they are infinitely farther extended. Our Paſſions do not only diſguiſe their principal Object, but likewiſe whatever has any relation to it: They not only make all the Qualities of our Friends agreeable, but alſo the greateſt part
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107782:34"/>of the Qualities of our Friends Friends. And even go farther in thoſe that have a great and ſtrong Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, for their Paſſions have ſo vaſt a dominion and extenſion, that it is impoſſible to determine their limits.</p>
                        <p>What I have already mentioned are ſuch general and pregnant Principles of Errors, Prejudices, and Injuſtices, that 'tis impoſſible to remark all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of them; Moſt of the Truths, or rather Errors, of certain Places, Times, Commonalties, and Families, have their riſe from them. What is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in <hi>Spain,</hi> is rejected in <hi>France;</hi> what is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox in <hi>Paris,</hi> is condemned at <hi>Rome;</hi> what the <hi>Dominicans</hi> eſpouſe, the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> diſapprove; and what is undoubted to the one, is erroneous to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Dominicans think it their Duty to follow Sr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and why? becauſe he was one of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and on the contrary the Franciſcans embrace the Opinions of <hi>Scotus,</hi> becauſe he belonged to theirs.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo Truths and Errors peculiar to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times; The Earth moved about Two thouſand years ago, and from thence it has continued fix'd till our days, and now begins to turn again. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has been formerly burnt, and a Provincial Council approved of by a Pope, has wiſely forbidden the teaching of his Phyſics; ever ſince he has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and now begins again to be deſpiſed. There are ſome Opinions now received in the Schools, which have formerly been look'd upon as Hereſies, and thoſe who maintained them have been Excommunicated as Hereticks by ſome of the Biſhops: Becauſe Paſſions cauſing Factions, theſe Factions produce ſuch Truths or Errors as are as inconſtant as the Cauſe which produces them, For inſtance, Men may be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in reſpect to the ſtability of the Earth, or the eſſence of Bodies : but continue no longer ſo,<note place="margin">Concil. Angl. per Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, An. <hi>1287.</hi>
                           </note> when they are maintained by ſuch as they hate. Thus Averſion upheld by a confuſed Senſe of Piety, produces an indifferent Zeal, which kindles by little and little, and at laſt cauſes ſuch Events as appears ſo ſtrange to every one a long time after they happen.</p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:107782:34"/>
                        <p>We can ſcarcely think that the Paſſions ſhould go ſo far, but 'tis becauſe we don't conſider they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to whatever can ſatisfie them. <hi>Haman</hi> it may be would have done no harm to the Jews, if <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> had ſaluted him, but he being a <hi>Jew,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing it, the whole Nation muſt periſh that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge might be the more magnificent.</p>
                        <p>When there is a diſpute between two Perſons who has a right to an Eſtate, they ought only to bring their Titles, and ſpeak what relates to their Caſe, or can beſt ſet it off; yet they fail not to uſe all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reproaches one againſt another, to contradict each other in every thing, and to introduce a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand unneceſſary Accuſations, and perplex their Suit with an infinite number of Acceſſory Circumſtances which confound the Cauſe. And indeed all Paſſions extend as far as the proſpect of their Mind who are moved with them; ſince there is nothing that we take to have any relation with the Object of our Paſſions, to which the motions of theſe Paſſions do not extend; which is done as follows.</p>
                        <p>The Traces of Objects are really ſo connected one with another in the Brain, that 'tis impoſſible the courſe of the Spirits ſhould violently ſtir up any of them, without affecting the reſt at the ſame time. The chief Idea therefore of what we think of, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily accompanied with a great number of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory Idea's, which are ſo much the more increaſed as the impreſſion of the Animal Spirits are more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. And this impreſſion of the Spirits ſeldom fails to be violent in the Paſſions, becauſe the Paſſions continually and powerfully force into the Brain an abundance of theſe Spirits that are proper to preſerve the Traces of the Idea's which repreſent their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Thus the motion of Love or Hatred extend not only to the principal Object of the Paſſion, but likewiſe to whatever we diſcover to have any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Object; becauſe in the Paſſion the motion of the Soul follows the perception of the Mind; even as the motion of the Animal Spirits in the Brain, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Traces of the Brain as well as thoſe which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107782:35"/>excite the chief Idea of the Object of the Paſſion, as thoſe that relate to it.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not therefore wonder if Men carry their Hatred or Love ſo far, and perform ſuch Capricious and Surprizing Actions. There is a particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all theſe Effects although we do not know them; becauſe their acceſſory Ideas are not always like ours, we cannot diſcover them. Thus there is always ſome cauſe or other for thoſe actions which appear moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and extravagant.</p>

                        <p>WHatever I have hitherto ſaid of the Paſſions is general, but it will not be very difficult to draw particular Inferences from thence; It is only requiſite to make ſome reflexion upon what paſſes within our ſelves, and the actions of others, for us to diſcover more of theſe ſort of Truths at one view, than we could explain in a conſiderable time. Yet there are ſo few Perſons who think of retiring into themſelves, and make any endeavour to that end, that to excite them to it, and ſtir up their attention, it will be neceſſary to deſcend to particulars.</p>
                        <p>When we hit or ſtrike our ſelves, it ſeems as if we were almoſt inſenſible; but if we are only touched by others, we receive Senſations lively enough to ſtir up our Attention. In ſhort, we never tickle our ſelves, or ſo much as think of it, and it may be we could not do it if we had a mind to it. 'Tis almoſt for the ſame reaſon that the Soul neglects to enquire into and examine it ſelf, it is immediately diſpleaſed with this ſort of enquiry, and is commonly incapable of diſcovering or perceiving what belongs to it, except when excited or ſtirred up by others. Thus to aſſiſt ſome Perſons in the knowing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107782:35"/>it is neceſſary to relate ſome of the particular Effects of the Paſſions, that by affecting them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, we may make them ſenſible of all the parts their Soul are compoſed of.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who will read what follows muſt neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be advertized, that they will not always be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that I touch them, nor will they always find themſelves ſubject to the Paſſions and Errors I ſhall ſpeak of, becauſe all particular Paſſions are not always the ſame in all Men.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true indeed all Men have the ſame Natural inclinations which have no relation to the Body, when their Bodies are perfectly well diſpoſed. But the different temperaments of Bodies, and their frequent changes, cauſe a great deal of variety in particular Paſſions. And if to the diverſity of the Body's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution we add that which proceeds from Objects, which likewiſe makes very different impreſſions upon all thoſe who have neither the ſame Employs nor manner of living; it is evident that ſuch a Perſon may feel himſelf ſtrongly affected in ſome place of his Soul by certain things, who will yet abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main inſenſible of many others. Thus we ſhould often be deceived, if we judged of what others feel by what paſſes in our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>I am not afraid of being miſtaken when I affirm that all Men would be happy, for I am abſolutely aſſured that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> Angels, Devils, and even all Spirits whatever, have an inclination for felicity. I know likewiſe that God will never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any Spirit without this deſire. Yet is it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that has taught it me, I never ſaw either <hi>Chineſe</hi> or <hi>Tartar;</hi> nor is it the inward teſtimony of my Conſcience, for that only teaches me I would be happy my ſelf: But 'tis God alone who can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly convince me that all other Men, Angels, and Devils, have a deſire to be happy; and 'tis he only who can aſſure me, that he will never give a Being to any Spirit who will be indifferent in reſpect to it. For who is there beſides himſelf that can poſitively aſſure me of what he does, and even of what he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107782:36"/>thinks? And as he can never deceive me, ſo I cannot doubt of what he teaches me. I am therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all Men would be happy becauſe this incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is natural, and depends not upon the Body.</p>
                        <p>But it is very different in particular Paſſions; For though I ſhould extreamly love Muſick, Dancing, Hunting, Sweetmeats, or Luxurious Diſhes, &amp;c. I could conclude nothing certain from thence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſſions of other Men. Pleaſure doubtleſs is ſweet and agreeable to all Men, but every one does not find it in the ſame Object: The love of pleaſure is a Natural inclination, depends not on the Body, and is therefore general to all Men. But the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Muſic, Dancing, and Hunting, is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, becauſe the diſpoſition of the Body on which it depends, being different in all Men, whatſoever Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions depend upon it, are not always the ſame.</p>
                        <p>General Paſſions, as Deſire, Joy, Sorrow, &amp;c. keep the mean between Natural inclinations, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Paſſions. They are general as well as the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but not equally ſtrong; becauſe that which produces and maintains them, is not always it ſelf equally active. There is alſo a great deal of variety in the degrees whereby the Animal Spirits are agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, in their plenty, and fineneſs, and in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the Fibres of the Brain and theſe Spirits.</p>
                        <p>Thus it often happens, that we don't at all affect ſome Perſons, when we ſpeak of particular Paſſions; but if we chance to touch them, they are violently moved. But with general Paſſions and Inclinations, it is quite contrary, we are always affected when they are mentioned, yet after ſuch a weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing manner, that we ſcarcely perceive it. I ſpeak theſe things to prevent any Perſons judging whether I am deceived, by the Senſation only which he has received of what I have already or ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſay, for I would have every one judge by conſidering the Nature of the Paſſſions I treat of.</p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:107782:36"/>
                        <p>If I propoſed the treating of every particular Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or to diſtinguiſh them by all the Objects which excite them; it's plain I ſhould never conclude, and ſhould only repeat the ſame thing: The firſt is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent becauſe the Objects of our Paſſions are infinite; and the laſt alſo, ſince we muſt always treat of the ſame Subject. The particular Paſſions for Poetry, Hiſtory, Mathematics, Hunting, and Dancing, are only one and the ſame general Paſſion; for, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Paſſions of Deſire or Joy, or for whatever pleaſes, differ not, although the peculiar Pleaſures which excite them do.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not therefore multiply the number of the Paſſions according to the number of Objects which are infinite, but only by the chief relations they may have in reſpect to us. And after this manner we ſhall diſcover, as will further appear upon our Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Love and Hatred are the Mother Paſſions, Which produce no other general Paſſions but Deſire, Joy, and Sorrow, and that particular Paſſions are compoſed only of theſe three firſt; and are ſo much the more compounded as the chief Idea of Good or Evil which excites them, is accompanied with a greater number of Acceſſory Ideas, or that the Good or Evil are more Circumſtantiated in reſpect to us.</p>
                        <p>If we remember what has been ſaid of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Ideas, and that in all great Paſſions the Animal Spirits being extreamly agitated, ſtir up in the Brain all the Traces which have any relation with the Object which affects us; we ſhall find, that there are an infinite number of different Paſſions which have no particular name, and which we can no way explain, but muſt confeſs they are inexplicable.</p>
                        <p>If the Original Paſſions which compoſe the reſt, were not capable of more or leſs; we ſhould have no difficulty in determining the number of all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but the number of thoſe Paſſions which are produced by the complication of others muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be infinite, becauſe the ſame Paſſion having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite degrees, it may by joining it ſelf with others be infinitely complicated: So that perhaps two Men
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107782:37"/>were never moved by the ſame Paſſion, if by the ſame Paſſion we underſtand the collecting together of all equal Motions, and like Senſations, which at the preſence of any Object is ſtirred up in us.</p>
                        <p>But as the <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> do not alter the Species, ſo we may ſay that the number of Paſſions is not infinite, becauſe the Circumſtances which accompany the Good or Evil may be limited. But let us explain our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in particular.</p>
                        <p>When we ſee any thing the firſt time, or when we have many time ſeen it attended with certain Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, we are ſurprized and admire at it if we afterwards ſee it appear in another manner. Thus a new Idea, or a new Connexion of old Ideas, begets in us an imperfect Paſſion, which is the firſt of all, and which I name Admiration. I call this Paſſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, becauſe it is neither excited by the Idea nor Senſation of Good.</p>
                        <p>The Brain being then ſhaken in certain places which never were before affected, or after a manner that is perfectly new, the Soul is ſenſibly touched with it, and conſequently ſtrongly applies it ſelf, to whatever it finds new in that object; for the ſame reaſon, as a ſimple tickling at the Soles of the Feet, excites a moſt lively and moving Senſation in the Soul, rather through the novelty than the force of the impreſſion. There is yet other Reaſons for the Souls applying it ſelf to Novelties, but I have explained them where I ſpoke of Natural Inclinations. We here conſider the Soul in relation to the Body, and according to this relation 'tis the emotion of the Spirits which is the Natural Cauſe of its application to new things.</p>
                        <p>In Admiration ſtrictly taken, we conſider things only as they are in themſelves, or according to their appearances; and not as they relate to us, or as they are good or bad. And therefore the Spirits diffuſe not themſelves through the Muſcles, to give a proper diſpoſition to the Body, to purſue good, or avoid evil; nor agitate the Nerves, which goes to the Heart, and to the reſt of the Bowels, to haſten, or delay the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and motion of the Blood, as it happens in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107782:37"/>the reſt of the Paſſions. All the Spirits go towards the Brain, there to trace a lively and diſtinct image of the ſurprizing object, that the Soul may conſider and know it again; But the reſt of the Body conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the ſame poſture, and as if it were immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For there being no emotion in the Soul, there is alſo no motion in the Body.</p>
                        <p>If what we admire appears great, the admiration is always followed with Eſteem, and ſometimes with Veneration: But on the contrary, it is always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Contempt, and ſometimes Diſdain, when it appears little.</p>
                        <p>The Idea of Greatneſs produces a great motion of Spirits in the Brain, and the trace that repreſents it is preſerved a long time: A great motion of Spirits likewiſe excites the Idea of Greatneſs in the Soul, and ſtrongly fixes the Mind on the conſideration of this Idea.</p>
                        <p>But the Idea of Littleneſs creates in the Brain but an inconſiderable motion of the Spirits, and the trace which repreſents it does not continue long. Alſo, when the Spirits are but little moved, they cauſe in the Soul an Idea of Meanneſs, and ſtays the Mind but a very little in the conſideration of this Idea: Theſe things deſerve to be well obſerved.</p>
                        <p>When we conſider our ſelves, or any thing which is united to us, our Admiration is always attended with ſome Paſſion which moves us. But this agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is only in the Soul, and in the Spirits which go to the Heart; becauſe there being no good that it makes us ſeek after, nor evil that it makes us ſhun, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are not diſperſed through the Muſcles to diſpoſe the Body to any action. The thoughts of the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Being, or of any thing belonging to it, naturally produces Pride, the eſteem of our Selves, contempt of others, Joy, and ſome other Paſſions. The proſpect of Grandeur produces Haughtineſs; that of Power, Generoſity or Boldneſs; and the ſight of any, other advantagious quality naturally produces ſome other Paſſion, which will be always a kind of Pride.</p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:107782:38"/>
                        <p>On the contrary, the foreſight of ſome Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Being, or of any thing which belongs to it, will naturally produce Humility, contempt of our ſelves, reſpect for others, ſorrow, and ſome other Paſſions. The proſpect of Poverty creates meanneſs of Spirit; that of weakneſs, Timerouſneſs; and thus the ſight of any diſadvantageous quality naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a Paſſion, which will be a kind of Humility. But this Humility, as well as that Pride, is properly neither a Virtue nor a Vice. They are both of 'em only Paſſions or involuntary Motions, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs very uſeful to civil Society, and even ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary in ſome occurrences for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Life or Goods of thoſe who are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by them.</p>
                        <p>It is neceſſary for inſtance, to be humble and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and even outwardly to teſtifie the diſpoſition of our Minds by a reſpectful and modeſt Air, when we are in the preſence of a Perſon of Quality, or of a proud and powerful Man: For 'tis commonly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for the Good of the Body, that the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ſubmit at the ſight of ſenſible Grandeur, and that it ſhould give it external Marks of its Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and inward Veneration. But this is Naturally and Mechanically performed without the Will's having any ſhare in it, and often even notwithſtanding all its Reſiſtance: Even Bruits themſelves have need of it, as Dogs, to prevail with thoſe they live with, have their Machine compoſed after ſuch a manner, that they aſſume ſuch an Air as they ought to have in relation to thoſe about 'em, as is abſolutely neceſſary for their preſervation. And if Birds, or any other Animals have not a fit diſpoſition of Body to give 'em this Air, 'tis becauſe they have no occaſion to aſſwage thoſe the effects of whoſe Anger they can avoid by flight; and without whoſe help they can preſerve their lives.</p>
                        <p>It cannot be too much conſidered that all the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are excited in us, at the ſight of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal object, does Mechanically imprint upon the face of thoſe that are ſtruck with it, a ſuitable Air, that is, an Air that Mechanically diſpoſes all thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107782:38"/>who ſee it to ſuch Paſſions and Motions as are uſeful to the good of Society; nay Admiration it ſelf, when it is only cauſed in us by the fight of ſomething Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and which others may conſider, as well as we, diffuſes through our Face an Air which Mechanically imprints Admiration in others, and which even acts upon their Brain after ſo regulated a manner, that the Spirits which are contained in it are impelled into the Muſcles of their Face, to form there an Air like ours.</p>
                        <p>This Communication of the Paſſions of the Soul, and Motions of the Animal Spirits, to unite Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in relation to good and evil, and to make 'em reſemble each other, not only by the diſpoſition of their Minds, but alſo by that of their Body, is ſo much the greater, and more obſervable as the Paſſions are more violent, becauſe then the Animal Spirits are agitated with more force; Now this is neceſſary, becauſe the Evils being greater or more preſent, we muſt apply our ſelves the more, and be ſtrongly united amongſt our ſelves, to ſhun, or to diſcover them, But when the Paſſions are very moderate, as Admiration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is, they don't ſenſibly communicate themſelves, nor produce ſuch an Air by which they are accuſtomed to do it. For ſince there's no extraordinary occaſion, 'twould be unneceſſary to put any force upon the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of others, or to divert them from their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; on which perhaps 'tis more requiſite they ſhould be engag'd, than in conſidering the Cauſes of theſe Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing more ſurpriſing than this Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of our Paſſions, and diſpoſition of our Body in relation to thoſe objects which encompaſs us. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is Machinally performed in us, is moſt worthy the Wiſdom of him who Created us. And as God has made us capable Of all the Paſſions which act in us, chiefly to unite us to all ſenſible things, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Society, and of our own Bodies, and his deſign is ſo faithfully executed by the conſtruction of his work, ſo we cannot but admire the Springs and curioſity thereof.</p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:107782:39"/>
                        <p>Yet our Paſſions, and all theſe imperceptible Bands by which we are united to whatever is about us, often prove through our faults, very conſiderable Cauſes of our Errors and Irregularities: For we make not that uſe we ought of our Paſſions; we permit them every thing, and do not ſo much as know the limits that ſhould be preſcribed to their Power. Thus even theſe Paſſions, which like Admiration are but weak, and agitate us the leaſt, have yet power enough to lead us into Error. Of which here follows ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                        <p>When Men, and chiefly thoſe who have a vigorous Imagination, conſider themſelves on the beſt ſide, they are commonly very well ſatisfied with themſelves; and their inward ſatisfaction never fails of encreaſing when they compare themſelves with ſuch as are more dull and heavy than they. Beſides, there is many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that admire 'em too; and very few who oppoſe them with any ſucceſs or applauſe; (for Reaſon is ſcarcely ever applauded in oppoſition to a ſtrong and lively imagination) and in ſhort, ſuch a ſenſible Air of ſubmiſſion and reſpect is form'd upon the Face of all their Hearers, who have likewiſe ſuch lively traces of admiration at every new word they ſpeak, that they alſo admire themſelves, and their Imagination ſwells them up with all theſe advantages, and makes 'em ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſatisfied in their own Abilities: For, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee a Paſſionate Man without receiving ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from his Paſſion, or in ſome meaſure enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our ſelves in his Sentiments; how could it be poſſible for thoſe, who are ſurrounded with a great number of Admirers, to give no reception to a Paſſion which ſo agreeably flatters Self-Love?</p>
                        <p>Now this high eſteem that Perſons of a ſtrong and lively Imagination have of themſelves, and their good Qualities, ſwell 'em up with Pride, and makes them aſſume a Majeſtic and Deciſive Air: They hear others with Contempt, anſwer 'em in Raillery, and only think in relation to themſelves; Looking upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Mind as a kind of Servitude, even where 'tis neceſſary to diſcover the Truth, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107782:39"/>wholly Indocible. Pride, Ignorance, and Blindneſs, are always Companions. The Mighty Wits, or rather the Proud and Vain-glorious ones, will never be Diſciples of the Truth: They never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire within themſelves, but to admire and applaud their own Acquirements: So that he, who reſiſts the Proud, ſhines in the midſt of their darkneſs without diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it.</p>
                        <p>There is, on the contrary, a certain diſpoſition in the Blood and Animal Spirits, which gives us too mean an opinion of our ſelves; Their ſcarcity, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, and fineneſs, joined to the groſſneſs of the Fibres of the Brain, make our Imagination weak and languiſhing: And the Sight, or rather confuſed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of this weakneſs and languor of our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, creates ſuch a vicious humility in us, as we may call meanneſs of Spirit.</p>
                        <p>All Men are capable of the Truth, but do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to him who is only able to teach them. The Proud depend upon themſelves, and hearken to none elſe; And theſe miſtaken humble ones, addreſs themſelves to the Proud, and ſubmit to all their Deciſions: Thus both liſten only to Man. The Mind of the Proud, obeys the fermentation of their own Blood, that is their own Imagination: And that of the mean ſpirited, ſubmits to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Air of the Proud; ſo that both are ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Vanity and Lyes. The Proud are like a rich and powerful Man, who having a great Equipage, meaſures his own greatneſs by the number of his Followers, and his ſtrength by that of his Horſes which draw his Coach. Theſe miſtaken humble ones, having the ſame Spirit and ſame Principles, reſemble a poor miſerable languiſhing wretch, who imagines himſelf almoſt nothing, becauſe he poſſeſſes nothing. Yet our Equipage is not our ſelves; and ſo far is the abundance of the Blood and Spirits, vigour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of the Imagination, from leading us to Truth, that, on the contrary, there is nothing which diverts us more from it. It is the dull, if I may call
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107782:40"/>them ſo, the cold and ſedate Minds, which are moſt capable of diſcovering the moſt ſolid and intricate Troths. In the ſilence of their Paſſions, they may hearken to that Truth which teaches them in the moſt ſecret receſſes of their Reaſon; but unhappily, they think not of applying themſelves to its word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſpeaks without a ſenſible luſtre, and in a low voice, and nothing affects them but a noiſe: Nothing convinces them but what ſeems ſparkling, great and magnificent, to the Judgment of the Senſes; they are not pleaſed without they are dazled, and chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hearken to thoſe Philoſopbers, who relate their Viſions and Dreams to them; and who, with the falſe Prophets of Old, affirm the Truth has ſpoken to them, tho' it has not, than to give Ear to the Truth it ſelf. For above this four thouſand years, the Pride of Man has, without oppoſition, put off lies and falſhoods, which have been reſpectfully received, and even preſerved as Holy and Divine Traditions. It ſeems as if the God of Truth was no longer with them; they neither conſult nor meditate on him any longer, but cover their idleneſs and neglect with the deceitful appearance of an holy Humility.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, of our ſelves, we cannot diſcover the Truth, but we may all times do it by the aſſiſtance of him who enlightens us; altho' we never can do it by the help of all the Men in the World. Thoſe even, who are beſt acquainted with it, cannot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to us, if we do not our ſelves inquire of him who has inform'd them, and if he anſwer not our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention as he has anſwered theirs. We muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receive any thing upon the credit of Man, for they are all Liers; but becauſe he who cannot deceive us has ſpoken to us, we ought continually to beg his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. We muſt not believe thoſe, who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ear, inſtruct only the Body, or, at moſt, act upon the Imagination; but we muſt attentively hearken, and faithfully believe him who ſpeaks to the Mind, inſtructs the Reaſon, and who penetrating into the moſt ſecret receſſes of the inward Man, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enlightening and fortifying it againſt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107782:40"/>and ſenſible Man, which continually endeavours to ſeduce and abuſe us. I ſo often repeat theſe things, becauſe I think them moſt worthy of a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion; 'Tis God alone that we muſt Honour, ſince there is none but ha who is able to give us know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or make us capable of Pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>There is ſometimes to be obſerved in the Animal Spirits, and the reſt of the Body, a certain diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which inclines us to Hunting, Dancing, Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and to all Exerciſes in general, wherein the ſtrength and agility of the Body are moſt conſpicuous. This diſpoſition is commonly in Young men, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thoſe whoſe Bodies are not perfectly form'd. Children cannot ſtay long in one place, but are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in action when they follow their humour: For as their Muſcles are not yet ſtrong, nor perfectly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, God, the Author of Nature, regulates the pleaſures of the Soul, in relation to the good of the Body, ſo as to make them find pleaſure in theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, which help to fortify and confirm the ſtrength of their Bodies. Thus, whilſt the Fleſh and Fibres of the Nerves are ſtill ſoft, the little paſſages, through which the Animal Spirits muſt neceſſarily flow, to produce all ſorts of motions, are kept open and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd; the humours have no time to ſettle, and all Obſtructions, and cauſes of Putrefaction, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                        <p>The confuſed Senſation which Young men have of the diſpoſition of their Bodies, make them pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the thoughts of their ſtrength and activity. They admire themſelves when they know how to meaſure their motions, or are able to make any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ones; and even wiſh to be in company of ſuch perſons as may behold and admire them. Thus, by little and little, they ſtrengthen their inclination for all bodily Exerciſes, which is one of the chief cauſes of the Ignorance and Brutality of Men: For beſides the time that is loſt in theſe Exerciſes, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uſe Men make of their Minds, is the cauſe that the chief part of the Brain, (whoſe flexibility produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a ſtrength and vivacity of Mind) becomes wholly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107782:41"/>untractable, and the Animal Spirits are not eaſily diſperſed through the Brain, after ſuch a manner, as to make them capable of thinking of whatever they pleaſe.</p>
                        <p>This is the reaſon that moſt part of the Nobility, and ſuch as are trained up to the War, are incapable of applying themſelves to any thing; they argue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things according to the Proverb, <hi>A Word and a Blow.</hi> And if we ſay any thing to them, they have not a mind to hear, inſtead of thinking what anſwer ought to be made; their Animal Spirits inſenſibly flow into the Muſcles, by whoſe aſſiſtance they lift up their Arms, and anſwer without any reflexion, by a blow, or ſome threatning geſture, becauſe their Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agitated by the words they hear, they are carried to thoſe places which are moſt open, through habit and exerciſe; and the knowledge they have of the ſtrength of their Bodies, confirms them in theſe inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent behaviours: And obſerving the reſpectful Air of thoſe who hear them, they are puft up with a fooliſh confidence, which makes them utter many fierce and brutiſh impertinencies, believing, at the ſame time, that they have ſpoke many fine things, becauſe the fear and prudence of others was favourable to them.</p>
                        <p>It is not poſſible to apply our ſelves to any Study, or actually to make a profeſſion of any Science with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; we can be neither Authors nor Doctors, without remembring what we are. But this alone, often, naturally, produces in the Mind of good men ſo many Defects, that 'twould be very advantageous for them if they were without thoſe honourable Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. As they imagine them to be their chief Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they always think on them with Pleaſure, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them to others with all poſſible Artifice, and even pretend they have given them a right to judge of all things without examination. If any Perſon has Courage enough to oppoſe them, they ſoon Craftily, and with a ſweet and obliging Air, inſinuate what they are, and the right they have to decide all things. But if afterwards any is ſo bold as to reſiſt them, and they want an anſwer, they will then openly ſay
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107782:41"/>what they think of themſelves, and thoſe who oppoſe them.</p>
                        <p>All inward Senſation of any advantage that we poſſeſs naturally encreaſes our Courage; A Soldier well Armed and Mounted, who wants neither Blood nor Spirits, is ready to undertake any thing: The diſpoſition he finds himſelf in makes him bold and daring. It is the ſame with a Learned Man, when he believes himſelf ſo, and when the vanity of his Heart has corrupted his Mind; he becomes, if we may ſay ſo, bold and confident againſt the Truth. Sometimes he raſhly oppoſes it without knowing it, and ſometimes betrays it after he has diſcovered it, and confiding in his falſe Learning, he is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to maintain the Negative or Affirmative, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Spirit of Contradiction poſſeſſes him.</p>
                        <p>It is very different with thoſe who boaſt not of their Learning; they are not deciſive: It is rare that they ſpeak if they have not ſomething to ſay. Nay, it often happens, that they are ſilent when they ought to ſpeak; they have not that reputation, nor thoſe external marks of Learning, which perſwade them to ſpeak they know not what. Theſe may ſafely hold their Tongues, but <hi>Pretenders</hi> to Sciences are affraid to continue ſilent, for they know, well they ſhall be deſpiſed if they hold their Tongues, although they have nothing material to ſay; and on the contrary, they will not always be condemned, although they ſay only impertinent things, provided they ſpeak them after a Scientific manner.</p>
                        <p>What makes men capable of thinking, makes them fit to diſcover Truth; but 'tis neither Honour, Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nor Dignities, nor falſe Learning, that can give them this capacity, it proceeds from their Nature: They are made to think, becauſe they are made for Truth. Even Health it ſelf is not ſufficient to make them think well, all that it can do is, not to be ſo great an impediment as Sickneſs is. Our Body, in ſome manner, aſſiſts us by Senſe and Imagination, but it does not help our Conception: For although, without help of the Body, we might, by meditation,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107782:42"/>oppoſe out Idea's to the continual Efforts of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Paſſions, which perplex and efface them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can only, at preſent, overcome the Body by the Body: Yet it is plain, that the Body cannot il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate the Mind, nor produce the Light of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in it, for every Idea which diſcovers the Truth, comes from Truth it ſelf. What the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives by the Body, is only for the Body it ſelf, and when it perſues thoſe Phantoms, it diſcovers nothing but Illuſions and Chimera's; I mean, it does not ſee things as they are in themſelves, but only as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Body.</p>
                        <p>If the Idea of our own greatneſs or littleneſs is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an occaſion of our Error, the Idea we have of external things, and what has any relation to us, cauſes not a leſt dangerous impreſſion. We have juſt ſaid, that the Idea of greatneſs is always attended with a great Motion of Spirits, and that a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirits is always accompanied with an Idea of greatneſs; and that, on the contray, the Idea of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs is always attended with a weak motion of Spirits, and that a weak Motion of the Spirits is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanied with an Idea of littleneſs. From this Principle 'tis eaſie to conclude, that ſuch things as produce a great Motion of to the Spirits in us, muſt naturally appear to us to have more Greatneſs, that is, more Power, more Reality, and more Perfection, than others, for by Greatneſs I mean all theſe things, and many ſuch like. So that Senſible Things muſt appear to us greater, and more ſolid, than thoſe which cannot be felt, if we judge of them by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits, and not by the pure Idea of Truth. A great Houſe, a magnificent Train, fine Furniture, Offices, Honours, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appear to have more greatneſs and reality in them, than Virtue and Juſtice do.</p>
                        <p>When we compare Virtue with Riches by a clear view of the Mind, then Virtue gains the preference; but when we make uſe of our Eyes and Imaginations, and judge of theſe things only by the emotion of the Spirits that they excite in us, we undoubtedly prefer Riches to Virtue.</p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:107782:42"/>
                        <p>'Tis from this Principle that we have ſo mean an Opinion of Spiritual things which do not affect the Senſes; That the Idea's of our Minds are leſs Noble than the Objects they repreſent; That there is leſs reality and ſubſtance in Air than in Metals, in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than in Ice; That the ſpaces betwixt Earth and Heaven are <hi>avoid,</hi> or elſe that the Bodies which fill it, have not ſo much reality and ſolidity as the Sun and Stars have. In fine, if we fall into an infinite number of Errors about the Nature and Perfection of every thing, 'tis becauſe we argue upon this falſe Principle.</p>
                        <p>A great motion of Spirits, and conſequently a ſtrong Paſſion, always accompanies a ſenſible Idea of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and a ſmall motion of Spirits, and a weak Paſſion likewiſe, attends a ſenſible Idea of littleneſs; We apply our ſelves much, and beſtow a great deal of our time in the Study of whatever may excite a ſenſible Idea of greatneſs, and neglect what gives us a ſenſible Idea of littleneſs. Thoſe great Bodies, for inſtance, which move about us, have always made an impreſſion upon us; we at firſt adored them, becauſe of the ſenſible Idea we had of their greatneſs and brightneſs. Some bolder <hi>Genii</hi> have examined their Motions; and in all Ages, the Stars have been the Object either of the Study or Veneration of many Men. We may even ſay, that the fear of theſe imaginary influences, which at this day terrify Aſtrologers and ſome weak Perſons, is a kind of adoration that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Imagination pays to the Idea of greatneſs, which repreſents theſe Coeleſtial Bodies.</p>
                        <p>The Body of Man, on the contrary, tho' infinitely more admirable and worthy our application, than whatever can be known of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> with all the reſt of the Planets, is almoſt unknown to us. The ſenſible Idea of the diſſected parts of the fleſh hath nothing great in it, and even cauſes diſguſt and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; ſo that 'tis but a few years ſince Ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons look'd upon Anatomy as a Science which meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their application. Kings and Princes have been Aſtronomers, and proud of that Title. The gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107782:43"/>of the Stars ſeemed to agree well with the greatneſs of their Dignities, but I don't believe they thought it any honour to underſtand Anatomy, and to be able to diſſect a Heart or a Brain well. It is the ſame with many other Sciences.</p>
                        <p>Rare and extraordinary things, produce greater and more ſenſible Motions in the Spirits than thoſe which we ſee every day; we admire them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affix ſome Idea of greatneſs to them, and thus they excite in the Spirits Paſſions of eſteem and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis this which overturns the Reaſon of many Men, for ſome are ſo curious and reſpectful for every thing of Antiquity, what comes from far, or is rare and extraordinary, that their Minds become Slaves to it, becauſe the Mind dares make no Judgment upon what it reſpects.</p>
                        <p>Truth, I grant, is in no great danger, becauſe ſome Men wholly employ themſelves about Medals, Arms, the Dreſs of the Ancients, the <hi>Chineſe</hi> or <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</hi> It is not abſolutely uſeleſs to know the Map of Old <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Roads from <hi>Tomquin</hi> to <hi>Nanquin,</hi> altho' it be more uſeful to know thoſe we ſhall have more occaſion to Travel. In fine, we have nothing to object againſt the knowledge of the true Hiſtory of the War of the <hi>Greeks</hi> with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or of the <hi>Tartars</hi> with the <hi>Chineſe;</hi> or that perſons ſhou'd have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary inclination for <hi>Thucidides</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or for any other that pleaſes them. But we cannot ſuffer that Reaſon ſhou'd be ſo ſubjected to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Antiquity; that we muſt be forbidden to make uſe of our Underſtanding to examine the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Ancients, and that thoſe who diſcover and ſhow the falſeneſs of them, ſhou'd paſs for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious and raſh Perſons.</p>
                        <p>There has been Truths in all Ages; if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has diſcovered ſome of them, further diſcoveries may be alſo made to this day: The Opinions of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor muſt be proved by good Reaſons, for if <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s Sentiments were ſolid in his time, they will be ſo now. 'Tis a pure illuſion, to pretend to prove Natural Truths by Humane Authority; perhaps we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107782:43"/>may prove, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had ſuch and ſuch thoughts upon certain Subjects, but 'twou'd not be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to read <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or any other Author what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, with much aſſiduity and pains, only to learn his Opinions Hiſtorically, and to inſtruct others after the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>We cannot, without ſome diſlike, conſider certain Univerſities which were Eſtabliſhed only for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into, and Defence of the Truth, that have now Eſpouſed a particular Sect and Glory in ſtudying and defending the Opinions of ſome Men: Nor can we, without ſome regret, read thoſe Philoſophers and Phyſicians who fill their Books with lo many Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that one wou'd rather take them for Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon Divinity and Civil Law, than Treatiſes of Phyſicks or Medicine: For who can be content to quit Reaſon and Experience, blindly to follow the Imaginations of <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Epicurus,</hi> or any other Philoſopher whatever?</p>
                        <p>However we might, perhaps, continue unmoved, and without reply, at the ſight of ſo ſtrange a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, if we did not feel our ſelves offended by it; I mean, if thoſe Gentlemen did not oppoſe themſelves to the Truth, to which only they ought to be united. But their Admiration for the Viſions of the Ancients, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with a blind Zeal againſt any new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the Truth; they decry them without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, oppoſe them without apprehending them, and by the power of their Imaginations, infuſe into the Mind and Heart of thoſe who hear and admire them, the ſame Senſations wherewith they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                        <p>As they judge of theſe new Diſcoveries only by the eſteem they have of their Authors, and ſince thoſe they have ſeen, and with whom they converſe, have not this great and extraordinary Air that the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation attributes, to Ancient Authors, they cannot eſteem them: For the Idea of the Men of our own Age, not being attended with theſe extraordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſtrike the Mind, it naturally excites no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Contempt.</p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:107782:44"/>
                        <p>Limners and Statuaries, never repreſent the Ancient Philoſophers like other Men; They make them great Heads, large and high Foreheads, long and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Beards. This is a good proof, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men naturally form a like Idea of them, for Painters draw things as they appear to them; they follow the natural motions of their Imaginations. Thus we generally look upon the Ancients as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Men; but, on the contrary, the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion repreſents the Men of our time like thoſe we ſee every day, and that producing no extraordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Spirits, it only excites in the Soul a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and indifferency for them.</p>
                        <p>I have ſeen <hi>D'Cartes,</hi> ſays one of theſe Learned Men who only admire Antiquity; I have known, and diſcourſed with him many times; he was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man; nor did he want Wit, yet he had nothing extraordinary. Thus he has a mean Idea of <hi>D'Cartes</hi> Philoſophy, becauſe he had diſcourſed ſome moments with him, and diſcovered nothing of this great and extraordinary Air in him which heats the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He even thinks it a ſufficient anſwer to any difficult Arguments of this Philoſopher which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd him a little, to ſay conſidently that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly known him. It were to be wiſhed, that theſe ſort of Men cou'd ſee <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> otherwiſe than in Painting, and have an hours Converſation with him, provided he ſpoke not to them in Greek, but in their own Tongue, without knowing who he was till after they had made a Judgment of him.</p>
                        <p>Whatever bears the Character of Novelty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe it is new in it ſelf, or that it appear in a new order or ſituation, it agitates us much, for it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Brain in places which are ſo much the more ſenſible, as they are leſs expoſed to the courſe of the Spirits; and ſuch things as have a ſenſible mark of greatneſs alſo affects us much, becauſe they excite a great Motion of Spirits in us. But what, at the ſame time, bears the Character of Greatneſs and Novelty too, does not only agitate us, it confounds, elevates, and aſtoniſheth us by its violent agitations.</p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:107782:44"/>
                        <p>Thoſe, for Inſtance, who ſpeak Paradoxes, make themſelves admired, for they ſay only ſuch things as have the Character of Novelty. Such as ſpeak in Sentences, and only uſe choice and proper Words, cauſe themſelves to be reſpected, for they ſeem to ſay ſomething great: But thoſe who join Eloquence to Novelty, the Great to the Extraordinary, ſeldom ever fail of raviſhing and aſtoniſhing the vulgar ſort, altho' they ſpeak nothing but impertinencies. This pompous and magnificent Jargon, <hi>inſano fulgoret,</hi> theſe falſe Lights of Orators, commonly dazle weak Minds; they make ſo lively and ſurprizing an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon their Imagination that they remain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and reſpect: this power which abaſes and blinds them, and admire, as the brighteſt Truths, ſuch confuſed Sentiments as cannot be expreſſed.</p>

                        <p>All the Paſſions have two very conſiderable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, they apply the Mind, and gain the Heart. By the former they may be very uſeful to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Truth, provided we know how to make uſe of them, for application produces knowledge, and knowledge diſcovers the Truth. But in reſpect to their gaining the Heart, they always produce an ill Effect; becauſe they only win it by corrupting the Reaſon, and repreſenting things to it not as they are in themſelves, or according to truth; but according to the relation they bear to us.</p>
                        <p>Of all Paſſions, that which leaſt affects the Heart is Admiration : For 'tis the proſpect of things that are either good or evil which agitates us, for the ſight of things as they are great or ſmall without any other relation to us, affects us very little or not at all. Thus Admiration which accompanies the knowledge of the greatneſs or ſmallneſs of new things which we would conſider, corrupt the Reaſon much leſs than any other Paſſion; and. it may even be of great uſe in the knowledge of the Truth, provided we take care to hinder its being followed by any of the other Paſſions, as it commonly happens.</p>
                        <p>In Admiration the Animal Spirits are forcibly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled towards thoſe places in the Brain which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the new Object as it is in it ſelf: They make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Traces there, and deep enough to continue a long time; conſequently the Mind has a clear Idea of them, and can eaſily reſolve them. Thus we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but Admiration may be very uſeful in the Sciences ſince it applies and inſtructs the Mind. It is not ſo with the reſt of the Paſſions, they apply the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107782:45"/>Mind, but inſtruct it not. They apply it becauſe they ſtir up the Animal Spirits; but they inſtruct it not, or elſe do it by a falſe and deceitful light, ſince after ſuch a manner they impel theſe ſame Spirits, as they repreſent Objects only according to the relation they have to us, and not as they are in themſelves.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing ſo difficult as to apply our ſelves long to any thing when we don't admire it, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits are not then eaſily carried to thoſe places which are neceſſary to repreſent it; 'twould be in vain to ſollicit our attention, we could not animadvert, or at leaſt not very long; although we might otherwiſe be perſwaded after an abſtracted manner, and which agitated not the Spirits, that the thing very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved our application. It is requiſite we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Imagination to ſtir up our Spirits, and that we ſhould after a new manner repreſent the Subject we would meditate on, that we might excite in our ſelves ſome motion of Admiration.</p>
                        <p>We every day ſee ſuch Perſons as have no inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Study, nothing appears more painful to them than application of Mind; yet are they convinced they ought to ſtudy certain things, and to that end they uſe their utmoſt endeavours; but they are unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and they advance not much; but immediately leave them. It is true the Animal Spirits obey the orders of the Will, and make it attentive whenever we deſire it: But when the Will, which commands, is purely reaſonable, and depends not upon any Paſſion, it is performed after ſo weak and languiſhing a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that our Ideas then reſemble Phantoms which are but juſt ſeen, and diſappear in a moment. Our Animal Spirits receive ſo many ſecret orders from our Paſſions, and both by Nature and habit, have ſo great a facility to execute them, as that they are very eaſily diverted from the new and difficult ways where the Will would engage them to go, ſo that 'tis chiefly in theſe Occurrences that we have need of particular Grace to aſſiſt us in the diſcovery of the Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot by our own power long reſiſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Body which conquer and ſuppreſs the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107782:46"/>Mind; or if we have this ability, we never make uſe of it.</p>
                        <p>But when we are excited by any motion of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Animal Spirits naturally diſperſe themſelves towards the Traces of the Object which cauſed it: They clearly repreſent it to the Mind; and produce in the Brain what is neceſſary to create knowledge and evidence, without troubling the Will to fatigue it ſelf by forcing theſe unwilling Spirits. Thus thoſe who are capable of Admiration are much fitter for Study than ſuch as are not ſuſceptible of it: The firſt are quick and ingenious, the laſt dull and ſtupid.</p>
                        <p>Yet when Admiration becomes exceſſive, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either to aſtoniſh or affright us, or does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to Rational Curioſity, it commonly produces ill Effects. For then the Animal Spirits are all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to repreſent the Object we admire on one ſide only; we don't even think whether we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it farther or not; nor do the Animal Spirits diſperſe themſelves ſo much as into the common parts of the Body, to perform their functions there; but imprint ſuch deep footſteps of the Object they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and break ſo great a number of the Fibres of the Brain, that the Idea they create can never after be effaced from the Mind.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough for Admiration to render us atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it muſt alſo make us curious: Nor is it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us to conſider one ſide of any Object to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it fully, we muſt examine it throughly, or elſe we cannot judge truly of it: So that when Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not induce us to examine things with the utmoſt exactneſs, or when it hinders us from it, it is very uſeleſs in the diſcovery of Truth: Then it only fills the Mind with probabilities and appearances, and inclines it to judge raſhly of every thing.</p>
                        <p>To Admire for Admiration ſake, is not ſufficient, we muſt Admire that we may afterwards examine with the more facility; the Animal Spirits which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſtir up Admiration in us, freely offer their aſſiſtance to the Soul, that it may uſe them to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107782:46"/>the Object more diſtinctly, and that it may better diſcover it. This is the inſtitution of Nature; for Admiration muſt lead us to Curioſity, and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity guide us to the diſcovery of Truth. But the Soul does not know how to make uſe of its power; it prefers a certain Senſation of Complacency which it receives from this abundance of Spirits that affect it, before the knowledge of the Object which excites them: It chooſes rather to enjoy plenty of Spirits than to diſſipate them by uſe, in which it reſembles certain Covetous Perſons, who prefer the poſſeſſion of their Silver, before the benefits they might in their Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities receive from it.</p>
                        <p>Men generally pleaſe themſelves with whatever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects them in any Paſſion; They don't only give their Money to make themſelves affected with Sorrow at the repreſentation of a Tragedy, but likewiſe throw it away upon Leigerdemain that may raiſe their Admiration; for we cannot ſay they give it to be deceived. The Senſation of Internal Pleaſure which the Soul feels in Admiration, is then the chief cauſe why we dwell upon it without making that uſe of it that Reaſon and Nature preſcribes us: For 'tis this Senſation of Complacency which keeps the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers ſo ſtrictly united to the Subjects of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; that they will fall into a Paſſion if we ſhew them the vanity of it. When an Afflicted Perſon taſtes the ſweetneſs of Sorrow, we anger him if we try to divert him from it; It is the ſame with thoſe who admire any thing, it ſeems to 'em as if we would injure them, when we endeavour to ſhew them their Admiration is without any Reaſon; becauſe they feel that ſecret Pleaſure they received from the Paſſion diminiſh proportionally as the Idea which cauſed it is effaced out of their Mind.</p>
                        <p>The Paſſions always endeavour to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and inſenſibly perſwade us that 'tis reaſonable to follow them: The Complacency and Pleaſure they make the Mind feel, which ought to be their Judge, corrupts it in their favour; and inſpires it with ſuch like Reaſoning: <hi>I ought to judge of things only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107782:47"/>to the Ideas I have of 'em: And of all my Ideas, the moſt ſenſible, are the moſt real, ſince they act the moſt powerfully upon me; It is therefore by them I ought the rather to judge: Now the Subject I admire includes a ſenſible Idea of greatneſs; then I muſt judge according to this Idea, for I ought to have an eſteem and love for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So that I have reaſon to ſtop at this Object, and employ my ſelf upon it; Indeed the pleaſure I feel, at the ſight of the Idea which repreſents it, is a Natural proof that 'tis my good to think upon it; for it ſeems to me that I grow great my ſelf whilſt I conſider it, and that my Mind has more extenſion when it embraces ſo great an Idea. The Mind ceaſing to be when it thinks of nothing, if this Idea ſhou'd vaniſh it ſeems to me that my Mind would vaniſh with it, or that it would become leſs and more contracted if it applied it ſelf to an Idea that was leſs. The preſervation of this great Idea, is then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the greatneſs and perfection of my Being; and therefore I have reaſon to admire it. Others alſo ought to admire me if they would do me juſtice, ſince I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing great through the relation I have to great things: I in ſome meaſure poſſeſs them by the admiration I have for them, and I feel the good by a foretaſte that a kind of hope makes me enjoy. Other Men would be happy as well as I, if knowing my greatneſs they like me applied themſelves to the Cauſe which produced it; but they are blind and have no knowledge of either great or fine things, and know not how either to raiſe or make themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come conſider able.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We may ſay the Mind naturally reaſons after this manner, without making any reflexion when it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it ſelf to be guided by the deceitful lights of its Paſſions. Theſe Arguments have ſome probability, bus 'tis plain they have no ſolidity in them: And this appearance or rather confuſed Senſation of it which attends theſe Natural Reaſonings made without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, have ſo much power, that if we don't take great care they will never fail of ſeducing us.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, when Poetry, Hiſtory, Chimiſtry, or any other Humane Science, has ſtruck the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of a young Man with any Motions of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107782:47"/>if he don't carefully watch the efforts theſe Motions make upon his Mind; If he does not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine what the advantages of theſe Sciences are; and compare the troubles he ſhall have in the learning, with the profit he ſhall afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them; and, in ſhort, if he is not as curious as is requiſite to judge well, there is a great deal of danger that his Admiration will not only ſhew him theſe Sciences with the faireſt ſide outwards, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him alſo. It is likewiſe very much to be feared that it will corrupt his Heart after ſuch a manner, that he ſhall not be able to deſtroy the illuſion, tho' he afterwards come to know it to be ſuch; becauſe 'tis impoſſible to efface ſuch deep Traces out of his Brain as a continual Admiration ſhall have wrought there. For that reaſon he muſt continually ſtir up the purity of his Imagination, he muſt hinder theſe dangerous Traces from being formed which will corrupt the Mind and Heart. I ſhall here preſcribe a very uſeful way to prevent not only the exceſs of Admiration, but alſo of all other Paſſions in general.</p>
                        <p>When the Motion of the Animal Spirits is violent enough, to make ſuch deep Traces in the Brain as corrupt the Imagination, it is always attended with ſome emotion of the Soul. Thus the Soul cannot be moved without being ſenſible of it, it is ſufficiently advertiſed to take care or it ſelf, and to examine whether it is advantageous that theſe Traces ſhould be ſtrengthned and made compleat. But in the time of the emotion, the Mind not being free enough to judge of the uſefulneſs of theſe Traces, becauſe this emotion deceives and inclines it to favour them; it muſt make its utmoſt endeavour to ſtop this emotion, or elſe divert the motion of the Spirits which cauſe it; and in the mean time it is abſolutely neceſſary for it to ſuſpend its Judgment.</p>
                        <p>Now it muſt not be imagined that the Soul can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways barely by its own Will ſtop this courſe of Spirits which hinder it from making uſe of its Reaſon. Its common powers are not ſufficient to make ſuch Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ceaſe which it has not excited. So that it muſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107782:48"/>make uſe of artifices to endeavour to deceive an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that attacks it only by ſurprize.</p>
                        <p>As the motion of the Spirits ſtir up certain thoughts in the Soul, ſo theſe Thoughts alſo excite certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our Brain. Thus, when we would ſtop any motion of the Spirits, which is ſtirred up in us, it is not ſufficient to will that it ſhould ceaſe, for that is not always capable of ſtoping it: We muſt make uſe of ſome Artifices, and repreſent things contrary to thoſe which excite and maintain this motion, and this would cauſe a Revulſion. But if we would only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine a motion of Spirits already excited to ſome other place, we muſt not think of contrary things, but only on ſuch things as differ from thoſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, and this will undoubtedly divert them.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe a Diverſion and Revulſion will be great or little in proportion as our new thoughts ſhall be attended with a great or leſs motion of Spirits; we muſt be very careful in obſerving well what thoſe Thoughts are which agitate as moſt, that in preſſing occaſions we may be able to repreſent, them to our Imagination which ſeduces us, and we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to form ſo ſtrong an habit of reſiſtance by this method, that the motion which ſurprizes us may be no more excited in our Souls.</p>
                        <p>If we take care to make an intent application of the Idea of Eternity, or any other ſerious Thoughts to theſe extraordinary motions which are excited in us, thoſe violent and great motions will never happen again without ſtirring up in us at the ſame time this Idea, and which will conſequently furniſh us with the means to reſiſt them. Thoſe things are proved both by Experience, and the Reaſons brought in the Chapter <hi>Of the Connection of Idea's:</hi> So that we ought not to think it abſolutely impoſſible by any Artifice to conquer the efforts of our Paſſions, when our Wills are firmly determined to do it.</p>
                        <p>However we muſt not pretend that we can become Impeccable, or ſhun all error by this manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. For firſt, 'tis difficult to acquire and preſerve ſuch an habit, as that our extraordinary Motions ſhall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107782:48"/>ſtir up in us ſuch Ideas as are proper to oppoſe them. Secondly, ſuppoſing we have acquired it, theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirits would directly excite thoſe Ideas which we muſt oppoſe, and but indirectly thoſe which we muſt oppoſe to them. So that the ill Idea's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principal, they will always have more power than thoſe which are only acceſſary: and it will be always neceſſary for the Will to aſſiſt the latter. In the third place, theſe motions of the Spirits may be ſo violent, that they may fill the whole capacity of the Soul, ſo that there remains no more room, if we may be permitted ſo to ſpeak, to receive the acceſſary Idea that is fit to make a Revulſion in the Spirits, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it after ſuch a manner as we may conſider it with any attention: In fine, there are ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culas circumſtances which may make this remedy uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that we muſt not too much confide in it, although on the other ſide we ought not to neglect it. We muſt continually have recourſe to Prayer, that we may receive from Heaven thoſe aſſiſtances as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the time of Temptations, and alſo endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſent to the Mind ſome Truth that is ſo ſolid and ſtrong, that by this means we may conquer the moſt violent Paſſions. For I muſt needs adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize by the way, that ſeveral pious Perſons often fall again into the ſame Errors, becauſe they fill their Minds with a great number of ſuch Truths as have more luſtre than power, and are fitter to diſſipate and divide their Minds than to fortifie it againſt Temptation; whereas unlearned and ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are faithful in their Duty, becauſe they make ſome great and ſerious Truth familiar to them, which fortifies and upholds them in all Occurrences.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> of Love and Averſion, and of their principal kinds.</head>
                        <p>LOve and Averſion are the firſt Paſſions which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed Admiration. We do not long conſider an object without diſcovering the Relations it has to us, or to ſomething that we Love: The object that we Love, and to which conſequently we are united, by Love, being almoſt always preſent to us, as well as that which we actually admire; our Mind without any pain, or great reflection, makes the neceſſary Compariſons to diſcover the Relations they have to each other, and to us, or elſe it is naturally adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of 'em by the preventing Senſations of Pleaſure and Complacency. And then the motion of Love we have for our ſelves, and the object that we Love, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf unto that we admire, if the relation that it immediately has with us, or with any thing we are united to, appears advantagious to us, either by Knowledge or Senſation. Now this new motion of the Soul, or rather motion of the Soul newly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, being joined to that of the Animal Spirits, and followed with the Senſation which accompanies the new diſpoſition, that this new motion of Spirits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in the Brain, is the Paſſion that we here call <hi>Love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if we feel by any Pain, or diſcover by a clear and evident Knowledge, that the union or relation of the object we admire, is diſadvantageous to us, or to any thing we are united to: Then the motion of Love that we have for our ſelves, and for what is united to us, is limited in us, or carried towards it; and follows not the ſight of the Mind, nor employs it ſelf on the object of our Admiration. But as the motion towards good in general, which the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture continually imprints in the Soul, carries us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what we know, and feel, to be ſo, becauſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107782:49"/>what is intelligible and ſenſible is good in it ſelf: We may ſay that the reſiſtance which the Soul makes againſt this natural motion that draws it away, is a kind of voluntary motion which terminates in Nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>Now this voluntary motion of the Soul being joyned to that of the Spirits and Blood,<note place="margin">That we may not be miſtaken in reſpect to what I here call volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Motion, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to read the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation upon the firſt Chapter.</note> and followed with the Senſation which accompanies the new diſpoſition that this motion of Spirits produces in the Brain, is the Paſſion that we here call <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Paſſion is abſolutely contrary to Love, yet is never without Love: It is wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, becauſe this ſeparates,<note place="margin">I ſhould only perplex the thought if I ſpoke whatever related to it, to ſatisfie ſome difficult Perſons,</note> and that unites: The former has Nothingneſs for its object, and the latter always ſome <hi>Being,</hi> whereby 'tis excited: Averſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſts natural Motion, and makes it of no effect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Love yields to it, and makes it victorious. But it is never ſeparated from Love; for if evil, which is its object, is taken for a privation of good, to fly evil is to fly the privation of good, that is, to incline towards good; and ſo that to hate the privation of good, is to love good it ſelf. But if evil is taken for Pain, and the averſion of Pain is not an averſion of the privation of Pleaſure, ſince Pain is as real a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as Pleaſure, it is not therefore the privation of it: but the averſion of Pain being the averſion to ſome inward Miſery, we ſhould not have this aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion if we had not love. Indeed, evil may be taken for whatever cauſes Pain in us, or deprives us of good: and then averſion depends upon the love of our ſelves, or of ſomething to which we wiſh to be united. Love and Hatred are then the two Mother Paſſions, and oppoſite to each other; but Love is the firſt, chief, and moſt Univerſal.</p>
                        <p>Being alſo ſince the Fall ſo far removed and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from good as we are, and looking upon our own being as the chief part of every thing we are united to, we may in one Senſe ſay, that the motion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107782:50"/>of Love, which we have to all things, is only a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Self-Love. We love Honours, becauſe they raiſe us above others; Riches, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and preſerve us; Our Relations, Prince, and Country, becauſe we are intereſted in their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The motion of love that we have for our ſelves extends to every thing that relates to us, and to whatever we are united: For 'tis even this motion which unites, and diffuſes, if I may ſo ſay, our Being into thoſe which encompaſs us, in proportion as we diſcover by Reaſon, or diſcern by Senſation, that 'tis advantageous to be united to them.</p>
                        <p>So that we muſt not think that ſince the Fall, Self-Love is only the cauſe and rule of all other Loves, but that moſt Loves are only kinds of Self-Love. For when we ſay a Man loves a new object, we muſt not think that a new motion of love is produced in this Man: But rather that knowing that this object has ſome relation or union with him, he loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that object, and by a motion of Love as old as himſelf. For indeed, without Grace, there is only Self-Love in the Heart of Man. For the love of Truth, Juſtice, and even of God himſelf, and every other Love that has been in us from the firſt Inftitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, is ever ſince the fall the Sacrifice of ſelf-love.</p>
                        <p>We doubt not nevertheleſs, but the moſt wicked and barbarous Men, as Idolaters, and even Atheiſts themſelves, are united to God by a Natural Love, and of which conſequently Self Love is not the cauſe. By Love they are united to Truth, Juſtice, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: They praiſe and eſteem good Men; and 'tis not becauſe they are Men that they love them, but becauſe they ſee good qualities in them which they cannot avoid loving, ſince they cannot hinder themſelves from admiring and judging them aimable. Thus we love ſomething elſe beſides our ſelves; but Self-Love is always predominant over all other loves. Men aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Truth and Juſtice for triffling Intereſts: and if by their natural Powers they hazard their Lives and Fortunes to defend oppreſſed innocency, or any other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107782:50"/>occaſion. They are induced by little elſe than Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and to make themſelves conſiderable by the apparent poſſeſſion of ſome Virtue which all the world reverences. They love Virtue and Juſtice, but never when 'tis againſt themſelves. They may love them when they agree, but never when they are oppoſite to their Intereſt: for they can never without Grace gain the leaſt conqueſt over Self-Love.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo many other natural loves: We Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally love our Prince, our Country, our Relations, and thoſe that we find conformable to our Humours, Deſigns, Employments; but all theſe loves are very weak, as well as the love of Truth and Juſtice, and Self-Love being the moſt violent of all loves, it always overcomes them, without finding any other reſiſtance than what it makes it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Bodies which ſtrike one another loſe their motion, in proportion as they communicate it to thoſe they meet; and they may at laſt loſe it all if they ſhock ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Bodies. But 'tis not ſo with Self-Love; it determines all other loves by the impreſſion it gives them, yet its motion diminiſhes not: On the contrary it acquires new Powers by its new Victories: and as its motion goes not out of the Heart, it is not loſt, although it is continually communicated.</p>
                        <p>Self-Love is then the commanding and univerſal Love; ſince it is found every where, and reigns where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is found. So that all the Paſſions have no other motion than that of Self-Love, we may alſo ſay, that Self-Love is the moſt extenſive, and ſtrongeſt of all Paſſions, or that 'tis the commanding and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Paſſion. For even as all Virtues are only kinds of the firſt Virtue, that we call Charity, as St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> has ſhown; ſo all Vices, and even all Paſſions, are likewiſe only conſequences or kinds of Self-Love, or proceed from this general Vice we call Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.</p>
                        <p>We often diſtinguiſh in Morality, the Virtues or Kinds of Charity by the difference of its Objects: but that ſometimes confounds the true Idea we ought to have of Virtue, which rather depends upon its own motive than on any thing elſe, and therefore we
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107782:51"/>ſhan't follow this method in treating of the Paſſions: We will not here diſtinguiſh them by their objects, becauſe one object alone may excite them all, and yet ten thouſand objects muſt excite but one: For altho' objects differ amongſt themſelves; they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways different in relation to us, and they excite not different Paſſions in us. A promiſed Marſhal's Staff differs from a promiſed Biſhop's Croſier; yet theſe two marks of Honour excite very near the ſame Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Ambitious Perſons; becauſe they ſtir up a like Idea of Good in the Mind. But the ſame Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal's Staff, when promiſed, granted, enjoyed, or taken away, excites very different Paſſions, ſince it raiſes in the Mind different Ideas of Good.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not therefore multiply the Paſſions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different Objects which cauſe them, but only admit ſo many of 'em, as there are acceſſary Ideas, which attend the principal Idea of Good or Evil, and conſiderably change it in relation to us. For the general Idea of Good, or the Senſation of Pleaſure, which is a good to him who taſtes it, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the Soul and Animal Spirits, it produces the general Paſſion of Love: And the acceſſory Ideas of this Good, determine the general agitation of the Soul, and the courſe of the Animal Spirits after a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner, which puts the Mind and Body into the diſpoſition it ought to be in relation to the Good we perceive, and thus they produce all particular Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>Thus the general Idea of Good produces an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Love, which is only an extenſion of Self-Love.</p>
                        <p>The Idea of the Good which we poſſeſs producs a a love of Joy.</p>
                        <p>The Idea of a Good that we do not yet, but hope hereafter to poſſeſs, that is, which we judge we may be able to poſſeſs, produces a love of Deſire.</p>
                        <p>In fine, the Idea of a Good which we poſſeſs not, nor have any hopes of poſſeſſing; or which is the ſame, the Idea of a Good that we have no hopes of poſſeſſing without the loſs of ſome other, or ſuch an one as we cannot preſerve when we poſſeſs it, produces a love of Sorrow. Theſe are the three ſimple or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107782:51"/>Paſſions which have Good for their object; for the hope which produces Joy, is not an emotion of the Soul, but a ſimple Judgment.</p>
                        <p>But we muſt obſerve that Men limit not their being in themſelves, but extend it to ail things and Perſons to whom it may appear advantagious to be united. So that we muſt conceive that they in ſome manner poſſeſs a good when their Friends enjoy it, although they do not immediately poſſeſs it themſelves. Thus when I ſay, that the poſſeſſion of Good produces Joy, I mean not only of the immediate union or poſſeſſion, but of all others; for we naturally feel Joy when any good fortune happens to thoſe we love.</p>
                        <p>Evil, as I have before ſaid; may be taken in three different ways, either for the privation of Good, or for Pain, or in fine, for the thing which cauſes the privation of Good, or produces Pain.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt Senſe, the Idea of Evil being the ſame with the Idea of a Good that we poſſeſs not, it is plain this Idea produces Sorrow, or Deſire, or even Joy: For Joy is always excited when we feel our ſelves deprived of the privation of Good, that is, when we poſſeſs Good. So that the Paſſions which regard evil, taken in this Senſe, are the ſame with thoſe which regard Good, becauſe in effect they have Good like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for their object.</p>
                        <p>But if by Evil we mean Pain, which only is always a real Evil to him who ſuffers it, whilſt he ſuffers it; then the ſenſation of this Evil produces the Paſſions of Sorrow, Deſire, and Joy, which are kinds of Hatred and not Love: for their motion is abſolutely oppoſite to that which accompanies the ſight of Good; this motion being only the oppoſition of the Soul, which reſiſts the natural impreſſion.</p>
                        <p>The actual Senſation of Pain produces ah averſion of Sorrow.</p>
                        <p>Pain, which we do not actually ſuffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but are afraid of ſuffering, produces an averſion of Deſire.</p>
                        <p>In fine, the Pain that we do not ſuffer, nor are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of ſuffering; or which is the ſame, the Pain that we do not foreſee we ſhall ſuffer without ſome great Recompence, or the Pain which we feel
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107782:52"/>our ſelves delivered from, produces an averſion of Joy. Theſe are the three primitive or ſimple Paſſions which have Evil for their object, for fear which produces Sorrow is not an emotion of the Soul, but a ſimple Judgment.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, if by Evil we mean the Perſon or thing which deprives us of Good, or makes us ſuffer Pain; the Idea of Evil produces a motion of Love and Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion together, or ſimply a motion of Averſion. The Idea of Evil produces a motion of Love and Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion together, when the Evil is what deprives us of a Good: For 'tis by the ſame motion that we encline towards Good, and remove our ſelves from what hinders our poſſeſſion of it. But this Idea only produces a motion of Averſion, when 'tis the Idea of an Evil, which makes us ſuffer Pain: for 'tis by the ſame motion of Averſion that we hate Pain, and whatever produces it.</p>
                        <p>Thus there are three ſimple or primitive Paſſions which reſpect Good, and as many others which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Pain, or which cauſes it, <hi>viz.</hi> Joy, Deſire, and Sorrow: For we have Joy when a Good is preſent, or an Evil paſt: We feel Sorrow when Good is paſt, and Evil preſent; and are agitated with Deſire, when Good and Evil are to come.</p>
                        <p>The Paſſions which regard Good are particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the motion which God gives us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Good in general, and therefore their object is real: But others who have not God for the cauſe of their motion, terminate only in nothingneſs.</p>

                        <p>IF we conſider how compound the Paſſions are, we ſhall plainly diſcover that their number can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be determined, and that there are many more of them than we have terms to expreſs. The Paſſions
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107782:52"/>do not only draw their differences from the various Combinations of the three firſt, for then there wou'd be but a few of them; but their difference proceeds likewiſe, from the different Perceptions, and different Judgments which cauſe or accompany them. The different Judgments which the Soul makes of Good and Evil, cauſe different Motions in the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to diſpoſe the Body in relation to the Object; and conſequently, create ſuch Senſations in the Soul, as are not abſolutely alike. Thus they are the cauſe, as we have obſerved, of the difference between cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Paſſions, whoſe emotions reſemble each other.</p>
                        <p>However, the emotion of the Soul being the chief thing which occurs in each of our Paſſions, it is much better to refer them all to the three Original ones, in which theſe emotions are very different, than to treat of them confuſedly and without order, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the different perceptions that we may have of the Good and Evil which cauſes them, for we may have ſo many different perceptions of Objects, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to time; to our ſelves, to what belongs to us, in relation to Perſons or Things, to which we are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either by Nature, or the choice of our Will, that it is abſolutely impoſſible to make an exact enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of them.</p>
                        <p>When the Soul perceives a Good which ſhe may enjoy, we may, perhaps, ſay, ſhe hopes for it, altho' ſhe deſires it not: But it is plain, this Hope is not a Paſſion, but a ſimple Judgment. So that 'tis the emotion which accompanies the Idea of Good, the poſſeſſion of which we judge to be poſſible, which makes this. Hope to be a true Paſſion. When Hope is changed into Security, 'tis ſtill the ſame thing; it is not a Paſſion only becauſe of the emotion of Joy which is then mixt with that of Deſire, for the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul, which conſiders a Good as not being likely to fail of it, is a Paſſion only, becauſe the foreſight of Good agitates us. In ſhort, when Hope diminiſhes, and Deſpair ſucceeds it, it is alſo plain that this Deſpair is a Paſſion only, becauſe of the emotion of Sorrow, which is then mixt with this Deſire; for the Judgment of the Soul, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107782:53"/>a Good as not being able to happen, is not a Paſſion except this Judgment agitates us.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe the Soul never conſiders Good or Evil without ſome emotion, and even without ſome change happen in the Body, we often give the Name of Paſſion to the Judgment which produces this Paſſion, becauſe we confound whatſoever paſſes in the Soul and Body at the ſight of any Good or Evil; for the words, Hope, Fear, Raſhneſs, Shame, Impudence, Anger, Pity, Deriſion, Regret, in ſhort, the Names we commonly give to all the other Paſſions, are ſhort expreſſions whereby we can expalain, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, whatever the Paſſions include.</p>
                        <p>By the word <hi>Paſſion,</hi> we underſtand the view of the relation that any thing has with us, the emotion and ſenſation of the Soul, the ſhaking of the Brain, and motion of the Spirits, a new emotion and new ſenſation of the Soul; and, in fine, a ſenſation of Complacency, which always attends the Paſſions, and makes them agreeable: All theſe things we mean by it. But ſometimes, by the Name of Paſſion, we only underſtand either the Judgment that excites it, or the emotion of the Soul, or the motion of the Spirits and Blood, or ſomething elſe which attends the emotion of the Soul.</p>
                        <p>To abridge Idea's and their expreſſions, is a very uſeful thing in the knowledge of Truth; yet it is often the cauſe of ſome great Error, when theſe Idea's are abridged through Popular Cuſtom, for we muſt never abridge our Idea's, but when we have made them clear and diſtinct by a great application of Mind, and not, as we commonly do, by the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all ſenſible Things, when once we have made them famillar by Senſations, and the meer action of the Imagination which deceives the Mind.</p>
                        <p>There is a great deal of difference between the pure Idea's of the Mind, and the ſenſations or emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul. The pure Idea's of the Mind are clear and diſtinct, but difficultly made familiar; whereas, on the contrary, the ſenſations and emotions of the Soul are very famillar, but impoſſible to be diſcern'd clearly and diſtinctly. Numbers, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107782:53"/>and their Properties, we clearly know; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have made them ſenſible by ſome Characters which expreſs them, 'tis difficult to preſent them, for whatever is abſtracted affects us not. Senſations, and the emotions of the Soul, on the contrary, are eaſily repreſented to the Mind, altho' we only know them after a very confuſed and imperfect manner, and all the terms which excite them ſtrongly agitate the Soul, and render it attentive. From whence it happens, that we often imagine we very well apprehend ſuch Diſcourſes as are abſolutely incomprehenſible; and when we read certain deſcriptions of the Senſations and Paſſions of the Soul, we perſwade our ſelves that we underſtand them perfectly, becauſe we are live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily touched with them, for all the words we read agitate the Soul. We have no ſooner pronounced the words Shame, Deſpair, Impudence, but it as ſoon ſtirs up in our Minds a certain confuſed Idea, and obſcure Senſation, which ſtrongly applies us; and becauſe this Senſation is very familiar, and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us without any trouble or effort of the Mind, we perſwade our ſelves that it is clear and diſtinct. Yet theſe words are the Names of compounded Paſſions; and conſequently, the abridged expreſſions that vulgar Cuſtom has made of many confuſed and obſcure Idea's.</p>
                        <p>As we are obliged to make uſe of ſuch terms as are approved by Cuſtom, ſo we muſt not be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to find obſcurity, and ſometimes a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, in our words. And if we reflected, that the ſenſations and emotions of the Soul, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to the terms we make uſe of in the like Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, are not perfectly the ſame in all Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their difference diſpoſitions of Mind, we ſhou'd not ſo eaſily condemn others when they are not of our Opinions. I don't ſay this ſo much to prevent the Objections which may be made againſt me, as to make the Nature of the Paſſions be well apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to teach us what we ought to think of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes which are written upon this Subject.</p>
                        <p>After all theſe precautions, I believe I may ſay that all the Paſſions may be referr'd to the three
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107782:54"/>Primitive ones, Deſire, Joy, and Sorrow; and that 'tis chiefly through the different Judgments the Soul makes of Good and Evil, that thoſe which relate to one and the ſame Primitive Paſſion differ amongſt themſelves.</p>
                        <p>I may ſay that Hope, Fear, and Irreſolution, which keep the Mean between theſe two, are kinds of deſire; that Boldneſs, Courage, Emulation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> relate more to Hope than to the other two; and that Fearfulneſs, Cowardiſe, and Jealouſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are kinds of Fear.</p>
                        <p>I may further ſay, that Cheerfulneſs and Glory, Favour and Acknowledgment, are kinds of Joy, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſight of the good we diſcover in our ſelves, or in thoſe to whom we are united; as Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Rallery is a ſort of Joy which is commonly excited in us, at the ſight of the Evil which happens to our Enemies. Laſtly, diſguſt, tediouſneſs, regret, pity, and indignation, are kinds of ſorrow cauſed at the ſight of ſomething which diſpleaſes us.</p>
                        <p>But beſides theſe Paſſions, and many others which I mention not, and which particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to ſome one of the Primitive Paſſions,<note place="margin">The number of the Paſſions is greater than the number of terms we expreſs 'em by.</note> there are alſo many others whoſe emotion is almoſt equally compound, either of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and Joy, as Impudence, Anger, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or of Deſire and Sorrow, as Shame, Regret, and Deſpight; or of all three when we meet with Motives of Joy and Sorrow joined together. But altho' theſe laſt Paſſions have not, as I know of, any particular Name, they are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the moſt common, becauſe in this Life we hardly ever enjoy any Good without the mixture of ſome Evil, and that we ſcarcely ever ſuffer any Evil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome hopes of being delivered from it, and of poſſeſſing ſome Good. And altho' Joy be quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Sorrow, it nevertheleſs admits it, and even with his Paſſion ſhares the Souls capacity of Willing, as he proſpect of Good and Evil divides the Souls capacity of perceiving.</p>
                        <p>All the Paſſions therefore are kinds of Deſire, Joy, and Sorrow; and the chief difference to be obſerved
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107782:54"/>between the Paſſions of the ſame kind, proceeds from the different Perceptions, or different Judgments which cauſe or accompany them; ſo that it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to enquire into the different Judgments that we make of Good and Evil. But as our chief deſign here is to ſearch after the cauſe of our Error, we ought not ſo much to ſtop at the examining the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which follow them, and which the Soul makes of Objects when it is agitated by any Paſſion, for 'tis theſe laſt Judgments which are the moſt liable to Error.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Judgments which precede and cauſe the Paſſions, are commonly falſe in ſomething, for they are generally upheld upon the perceptions of the Soul, in as much as it conſiders things in relation to it ſelf, and not according as they are in themſelves: But thoſe Judgments which follow the Paſſions are falſe in every reſpect, for the Judgments which form the Paſſions are upheld only upon the perceptions the Soul has of Objects in relation to it ſelf, or rather in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its emotion.</p>
                        <p>In thoſe Judgments which precede the Paſſions, both the true and the falſe are joined together; but when the Soul is agitated, and Judges of every thing according to the inſpiration of the Paſſion, the true is diſſipated, and the falſe preſerved, from whence are drawn ſo many more falſe concluſions as the Paſſion is greater.</p>
                        <p>Every Paſſion juſtifies it ſelf; they continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the Soul that Object which affects it, after ſuch a manner as is moſt proper to preſerve and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its agitation. The Judgment or Perception which cauſes it, is fortified in proportion as the Paſſion encreaſes; and the Paſſion encreaſes ini proportion as the Judgment which produces it, is in its turn fortified: Falſe Judgments and Paſſions continually contribute to their mutual preſervation. So that if the Heart ceaſed not ſometimes to ſupply ſuch Spirits as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to maintain the traces of the Brain, and the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of the ſame Spirits, which are neceſſary to preſerve the ſenſation and emotion of the Soul which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107782:55"/>accompanies the Paſſions, they wou'd continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and we ſhou'd never diſcover our Errors. But as all our Paſſions depend upon the fermentation and circulation of the Blood, and as the Heart cannot always furniſh ſuch Spirits as are requiſite for their preſervation, they muſt neceſſarily ceaſe when the Spirits diminiſh and the Blood cools.</p>
                        <p>If it is ſo very eaſie to diſcover the common Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Paſſions, we ought not to neglect it; There are few Subjectys more worthy the application of thoſe who enquire into the Truth, and endeavor to deliver themſelves from the dominion of their Bodies, and who wou'd judge of all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true Idea's of them.</p>
                        <p>We may inſtruct our ſelves upon this Subject two different ways, either by reaſon only, or by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſation that we have of our ſelves when we are agitated with any Paſſion. For inſtance, we know by our own Experience, that we are inclined to judge diſadvantageouſly of thoſe we love not, and to diſcover all the malignity of our hatred, by that means, to the Object of our Paſſion. We may alſo, by pure Reaſon, diſcover that hating only what is Evil, it is neceſſary for the preſervation of hatred, that the Mind ſhou'd repreſent its Object on the worſt ſide; for, indeed, it is ſufficient to ſuppoſe all the Paſſions juſtify themſelves, and that they divert the Imagination, and afterwards the Mind, in ſuch a manner as is fit to preſerve their own emotion, that we conclude what thoſe Judgments are which all the Paſſions cauſe us to make.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who have a ſtrong and lively Imagination, are extreamly ſenſible, and very ſubject to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Paſſions, may perfectly inſtruct themſelves in theſe things by the ſenſation they have of what paſſes within them; and even ſpeak of them after a more agreeable manner, and ſometimes more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, than thoſe who have more Reaſon than Imagination. For, we muſt not think that ſuch as beſt diſcover the Springs of Self-love, that penetrate fartheſt, and after a more ſenſible manner, unfold the ſecrets of Man's heart, are always the moſt Learned:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107782:55"/>'Tis, indeed, often a mark that they are more lively, more imaginative, and ſometimes more malicious than others.</p>
                        <p>But thoſe who without conſulting their internal Senſation, only make uſe of their Reaſon to diſcover the Nature of their Paſſions, and what they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing, if they are not always as pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating as others, they are always more reaſonable, and leſs ſubject to Error, for they judge of things as they are in themſelves: They ſee very near what the Paſſions can perform, according as they ſuppoſe them more or leſs moved, and they do not judge raſhly of ſuch things as others wou'd, or wou'd not do in ſuch occurrences, by what they wou'd do themſelves; for they very well know, that all men are not equally ſenſible of the ſame things, nor equally ſuſceptible of involuntary emotions, ſo that 'tis not by conſulting the Senſations which the Paſſions excite in us, but by hearkning to Reaſon, that we muſt ſpeak of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which accompany the Paſſions, leſt we ſhou'd only diſcover our ſelves inſtead of ſhowing the Nature of the Paſſions in general.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> How all the Paſſions juſtifie themſelves, and of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they cauſe us to make in their vindication.</head>
                        <p>IT will not be neceſſary to bring many Arguments to demonſtrate that all the Paſſions juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: This Principle is evident enough by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senſation we have of our ſelves, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe whom we ſee agitated with any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it will be ſufficient to expoſe it, that we may afterwards take heed of it. The Mind is ſuch a ſlave to the Imagination, that it always obeys it, when it is heated by it: It dares not anſwer it when 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd, becauſe it treats it ill if it makes any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and always recompences it with ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure when it acquieſſes in its deſigns. Thoſe even
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107782:56"/>whoſe imagination is ſo irregular that they believe themſelves transformed into Beaſts, find ſome reaſons to prove that they ought to live like them; walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all four, feed upon Graſs, and imitate all the actions which agree only to Beaſts. They find a great deal of pleaſure in following the impreſſions of their Paſſions; and feel themſelves inwardly afflicted when they reſiſt them: and 'tis enough, if reaſon, which accommodates it ſelf, and is commonly ſerviceable to pleaſure, argues after ſuch a manner as is proper to defend the cauſe of it.</p>
                        <p>If therefore it be true that all Paſſions juſtifie themſelves, it is evident that deſire of it ſelf inclines us to judge advantageouſly of its Object, if it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of love; and diſadvantageouſly, if 'tis a deſire of averſion. The deſire of love is a motion of the Soul excited by the Spirits, to will the enjoyment or uſe of ſuch things as are not in our power; for if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the continuation of our enjoyment, 'tis becauſe future things are not in our power. It is therefore neceſſary to juſtifie deſire, that the Object which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces it ſhould be judged good in it ſelf, or in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſome other; and we muſt think the contrary of that deſire which is a kind of averſion.</p>
                        <p>It is true we cannot judge a thing to be good or bad, if there is not ſome reaſon for it; but there is no Object of our Paſſions which is not good in ſome ſenſe: If we can ſay that there is ſome of them which include no good, and which conſequently cannot be perceived as good by the ſight of the Mind; yet it cannot be ſaid but they may be reliſhed as good, ſince we ſuppoſe our ſelves to be agitated by them; and this taſte or ſenſation is ſufficient to incline the Soul to judge advantageouſly of an Object.</p>
                        <p>If we judge ſo eaſily that Fire contains in it ſelf the heat we feel, and Bread the ſavour we taſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſenſations that theſe Bodies excite in us, although it be wholly incomprehenſible to the Mind, ſince that can only conceive heat and ſavour, to be the <hi>manners of being</hi> of a Body; there is no Object of our Paſſions how vile and contemptible ſoever it appears to be, that we do not judge to be good when
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107782:56"/>we feel pleaſure in the enjoyment of it. For as we imagine that heat goes our of Fire when we feel it, we blindly believe that the Object of the Paſſions cauſe the pleaſure that we taſte when we enjoy them; and that therefore they are good ſince they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing us good; the ſame may be ſaid of thoſe Paſſions which have evil for their Object.</p>
                        <p>But as I have juſt before ſaid, there is nothing which is not worthy of love or averſion, either in it ſelf, or ſomething elſe to which it has relation; and when we are agitated by any Paſſion, we ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the good or evil in its Object which favours or oppoſes it. Thus by reaſon 'tis eaſie to find out what Judgments theſe Paſſions, whereby we are agitated, form in us.</p>
                        <p>For if 'tis a deſire of love which acts us, we ſoon apprehend that it will not fail to juſtifie it ſelf by the advantageous judgments it will make upon its Object. We eaſily ſee theſe Judgments will be ſo much the more extended, as the deſire is more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and that they will be often full and abſolute al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the thing appears only good in part, without we eaſily conceive that theſe advantageous Judgments will extend to every thing which has or ſeems to have any connection with the principal Object of the Paſſion; and that ſo much the more as the Paſſion is ſtronger, and the Imagination more extenſive. But if it be a deſire of averſion, the quite contrary will happen, for Reaſons as eaſily apprehended. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſufficiently proves theſe things, and therein it perfectly agrees with Reaſon; but we will make theſe Truths more ſenſible by ſome Inſtances.</p>
                        <p>All Men naturally deſire Knowledge, for every Mind is made for the Truth: But the deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how juſt and reaſonable ſoever it may be in it ſelf, often becomes a very dangerous Vice through the falſe Judgments which attend it. Curioſity often offers to the Mind the main Objects of its Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Cares: It often affixes falſe Ideas of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to theſe Objects: It elevates them by the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſtre of rarity, and repreſents them ſo charming
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107782:57"/>and attractive, that 'tis difficult to contemplate them without too much pleaſure and application.</p>
                        <p>There is no trifle whatever, but ſome Perſons are wholly taken up about, and their employment is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways juſtified by the falſe judgments their vain curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity induces them to make. Thoſe, for inſtance, who are curious about words, imagine it to be a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of certain terms wherein all Sciences conſiſt: They find a thouſand Arguments to perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it, and the veneration paid them by thoſe, who are confounded by unknown terms, is none of the weakeſt although it be the leaſt reaſonable.</p>
                        <p>Some Men are learning all their lives to ſpeak, who yet perhaps ought to be ſilent as long as they live; for 'tis evident we ſhould hold our Tongues when we have nothing to ſay that is worth the hearing; but they don't learn to ſpeak, to remain ſilent. They do not ſufficiently conſider, that to be able to ſpeak well, 'tis requiſite to think well, have an exact judgment, to diſcern truth from falſehood, clear Ideas from thoſe which are obſcure, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh thoſe of the Mind, from ſuch as proceed from the Imagination. They think themſelves uncommon and curious Wits, becauſe they know how to ſatisfie the Ear by an exact meaſure, flatter the Paſſions by figures and agreeable motions, and delight the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination by ſenſible and lively Expreſſions, whilſt they leave the Mind empty of Ideas without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who imploy a great part of their time in the ſtudy of their own Tongue, have ſome appearance of Reaſon to juſtifie them, ſince they make uſe of it all their lives; and this is enough to excuſe the Paſſion of ſome Perſons. But I confeſs it difficult with any ſhadow of Reaſon, to excuſe the Paſſion of ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently apply themſelves to all ſorts of Languages. Something may be ſaid in favour of their Inclination who make a compleat Library of all ſorts of Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, as well as for the Curioſity of ſuch, who col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Coins of all Nations and Ages; ſince it may be uſeful in ſome Occurrences; and if it is no great advantage to them, at leaſt 'tis no injury; for they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107782:57"/>have a Storehouſe of Curioſities which does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex them, ſince they carry about them neither their Books nor their Medals; But I don't ſee how we can juſtifie the Paſſion of thoſe who make their Head a Library of Dictionaries; They even forget their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and moſt eſſential Duties, for Words of no uſe; They ſpeak their own Tongue with heſitation, and at every turn mix unknown and barbarons terms in their Diſcourſes, and never ſpeak to their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their own Language. And indeed their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is no better managed than their Tongue, for every corner and receſs of their Memory is full of Etymologies, that their Minds are as it were choaked with an innumerable company of Words, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fly about it.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs it muſt be granted that Philologiſts and Linguiſts will not fail to juſtifie their trifling Studies; But how! only hear the Judgments that thoſe falſly Learned Perſons make of the Tongues, and you ſhall know it: Or elſe do but ſuppoſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Axioms which paſs amongſt them for indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and from thence draw their uſual Conſequences; for inſtance, that thoſe who underſtand ſeveral Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, are as many different Men, as they can ſpeak Tongues, ſince 'tis by ſpeech they are diſtinguiſhed from Beaſts: That being unaquainted with the Tongues, is the reaſon we are ignorant of an infinite number of things, ſince the Ancient Philoſophers and Strangers are much more learned than we are; Thus, if we ſuppoſe the like Principles and Concluſions, we ſhall ſoon form ſuch Judgments as are fit to produce a Paſſion for Languages, and which Judgments will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be like thoſe that the ſame Paſſion creates in Philologiſts for the juſtification of their Studies.</p>
                        <p>The meaneſt and moſt contemptible Sciences, will in ſome part or other appear glorious to the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and will eaſily dazle the Mind through the falſe luſtre that Paſſion diffuſes through it. It is true, this ſplendor vaniſhes, when the Spirits and Blood are cooled, and the light of truth begins to appear; but this light is likewiſe diſſipated when the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation becomes warm, and obſcurely preſents to us
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107782:58"/>thoſe ſolid Reaſons which ſeemed to condemn our Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>But when the Paſſion which animated us, feels it ſelf decaying, it does not repent of its conduct; on the contrary we may ſay, that it diſpoſes of all things in ſuch a manner, that it may dye with honour, or elſe revive again ſoon after: That is, it always inclines the Mind to form ſuch Judgments as juſtifie it. In this condition it alſo contracts a kind of Covenant with all the reſt of the Paſſions, which can aſſiſt it in its weakneſs, ſupply it with Spirits and Blood at its neceſſity, rekindle its aſhes, and give it new life; for the Paſſions are not indifferent in reſpect to each other; and thoſe which can live together faithfully contribute to one anothers preſervation. Thus the Judgments, which juſtifie the inclination we have for Languages, or what elſe pleaſes us, are continually ſolicited and fully confirmed by all the Paſſions which are not oppoſite to it.</p>
                        <p>A pretender to Learning ſometimes fancies himſelf ſurrounded with ſuch Perſons as hear him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſometimes as victorious over thoſe whom he has aſtoniſhed by his incomprehenſible Words, and generally thinks himſelf far above the common ſort of Men. He flatters himſelf with the praiſes they give him, the preferments propoſed to him, and with the courſhips made to his Perſon. He is of all times and Countreys, and not limited like common Wits, to the preſent time, or within the Walls of his own Town; but continually communicates himſelf, and this communication creates his pleaſure. Thus many Paſſions combine with that he has for falſe Learning, which all endeavour to juſtifie it, and warmly ſolicite the Judgments in its favour.</p>
                        <p>It every Paſſion acted only for it ſelf, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerned for the reſt, they would immediately diſſipate after they were produced; not being able to make falſe Judgments enough for their own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, nor to maintain long the repreſentations of the Imagination againſt the light of Reaſon. But every thing is regulated in our Paſſions after the moſt exact manner that is poſſible, for their mutual preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:107782:58"/>
                        <p>They fortifie one another, the moſt remote giving ſome aſſiſtance; and 'tis enough for 'em, if they are not declared enemies, to obſerve amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all the rules of a well ordered Society.</p>
                        <p>Should the Paſſion of Deſire be alone, every Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that proceeded from it, could only tend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the good as poſſible; for the deſire of love, conſidered as ſuch, is produced only by the Judgment that we make of the poſſeſſion of ſome good that is attainable; ſo that this deſire could only form Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the poſſibility of enjoying it, ſince thoſe Judgments which follow and preſerve the Paſſions, are wholly like thoſe which precede and produce them. But deſire is animated by love, fortified by hope, encreaſed by joy, renewed by fear, attended with courage, emulation, anger, irreſolution, and many other Paſſions; which in their turns form an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety of Judgments, that ſucceed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo maintain the deſire which produced them. It is no wonder therefore if the deſire of a pure trifle, or of ſomething that is manifeſtly uſeleſs, or injurious, continually juſtifies it ſelf in oppoſition to Reaſon, for many years, or during the whole Life of a Man who is agitated by it, ſince there are ſo many Paſſions which plead in its behalf. And that I may explain things by diſtinct Ideas, I ſhall briefly ſhew how the Paſſions juſtifie themſelves.</p>
                        <p>All Paſſion agitates the Blood and Spirits; and theſe agitated Spirits are carried to the Brain, either by the ſenſible ſight of the Object, or power of the Imagination, after ſuch a manner as is proper to form deep Traces to repreſent this Object: By their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous courſe they bend, and even ſometimes break the Fibres of the Brain, and the Imagination is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſully'd and corrupted. For theſe Traces ſubmit not to Reaſon, they are not effaced when that wiſhes it; but on the contrary do violence to it, and even continually oblige it to conſider Objects, after ſuch a manner as agitates and inclines it to favour the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Thus the Paſſions act upon the Imagination, and the Imagination being corrupted fights againſt Reaſon, by continually repreſenting things to it, not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107782:59"/>according as they are in themſelves, whereby the Mind might make a true Judgment, but as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the preſent Paſſion, to incline it to make a Judgment in favour of it.</p>
                        <p>The Paſſions do not only corrupt both the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Mind in favour of 'em, but likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the reſt of the Body every diſpoſition that is neceſſary for their preſervation. The Spirits which are agitated by them ſtop not in the Brain, but are carried, as I have already intimated, to all the other parts of the Body; They are chiefly diſperſed into the Heart, Liver, Spleen, and into the Nerves which encompaſs the principal Arteries: In ſhort, they are thrown into all parts whatever, which can ſupply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Spirits for the preſervation of the ruling Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But when theſe Spirits are thus diſperſed into the parts of the Body, they by little and little deſtroy whatever can reſiſt their courſe; till at laſt they make their paſſage ſo ſlippery and ſmooth, that the ſmalleſt Object extreamly agitates us, and conſequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to form ſuch Judgments as favour the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And 'tis after this manner that they eſtabliſh and juſtifie themſelves.</p>
                        <p>If we conſider how various the conſtitution of the Fibres of the Brain is, how different the agitation and abundance of the Spirits and Blood in different Sexes, and at different Ages; it will be eaſie enough to diſcover very near what Paſſions certain Perſons are moſt ſubject to, and conſequently what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they will make upon ſuch Objects. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; we may nearly gueſs by the abundance or ſcarcity of Spirits, which we obſerve in certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that the very ſame thing being equally propoſed and explained to them, many will form Judgments of hope and joy upon it, and others of fear and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                        <p>For thoſe who have abundance of Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as commonly Young Men, Sanguine and Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Perſons have, eaſily conceive hope, becauſe of the ſecret ſenſe of their Strength; They will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſhall find any oppoſition in their deſigns which they cannot conquer; and immediately pleaſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107782:59"/>themſelves with the foretaſt of a good they hope to poſſeſs; and will form all ſorts of Judgments which are fit to juſtifie their hope and joy. But ſuch as want agitated Spirits, as Old Men, Melancholy and Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Perſons do, being inclined to fear and ſorrow, becauſe their Soul grows weak, and is deſtitute of Spirits to execute its Orders, they form quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Judgments, imagining unconquerable difficulties to juſtifie their fear, and abandon themſelves to envy, ſorrow, deſpair, and to certain kinds of averſion, of which weak Perſons are moſt ſuſceptible.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> That ſuch Paſſions, as have Evil for their Object, are moſt dangerous and unjuſt; and ſuch as are attended with the leaſt knowledge, are the moſt lively and ſenſible.</head>
                        <p>OF all the Paſſions, thoſe whoſe Judgments are moſt unreaſonable, and moſt to be feared, are all kinds of Averſion. There are no Paſſions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that corrupts the Reaſon more in favour of 'em, than hatred and fear do: Hatred chiefly in the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, or in ſuch whoſe Spirits are in continual agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and Fear in the Melancholic, or in thoſe whoſe groſs and heavy Spirits are neither ſoon agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, nor eaſily appeaſed. But when Hatred and Fear conſpire together to corrupt the Reaſon, which is very common, then there are no Judgments ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and fantaſtic, but they are capable of producing and maintaining with an inſuperable obſtinacy.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon of which is, becauſe the Soul is in this life more lively affected with evil than good, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of pain being more quick than that of pleaſure. We are much more ſenſible of injuries and reproaches than praiſes and applauſe; and if we meet with ſome Perſons that have a great indifference for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certain pleaſures, or the receiving of certain honours, yet would it be very difficult to find any who would quietly ſuffer pain and contempt.</p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:107782:60"/>
                        <p>Thus Hatred, Fear, and the other kinds of Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which have Evil for their Object, are very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſions. They give the Mind ſuch unforeſeen ſhocks, and ſtupify and diſcompoſe it; and ſoon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the moſt ſecret receſſes of the Soul; They dethrone Reaſon, and upon all ſorts of ſubjects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce erroneous and unjuſt Judgments, in favour of their folly and tyranny.</p>
                        <p>Of all the Paſſions theſe are the moſt cruel and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful, the moſt deſtructive to Charity and Civil Society, and likewiſe the moſt ridiculous and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigant: for they form ſuch impertinent and fantaſtic Judgments, as excites the laughter and indignation of all Men.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Paſſions put theſe extravagant Speeches in the Mouth of the Phariſees:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Joh.</hi> c. 11.47.</note> 
                           <hi>What do we? this Man works many Miracles. If we let him alone all Men will believe in him: And the Romans will come and deſtroy both our City and Nation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They agreed that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> did many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; the reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was undeniable. But what was the Judgment of their Paſſions? To put <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> to death, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom he had raiſed to life: And why muſt <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> die? becauſe, <hi>if we let him alone, all Men will believe him, and the Romans will come and ruine our Nation:</hi> And why muſt <hi>Lazarus</hi> be put to death? becauſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his account many Jews went away and believed in <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Joh.</hi> c. 12.11.</note> Theſe are both cruel and extravagant Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments together; cruel through hatred, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant through fear: <hi>The Romans will come and ruine our City and Nation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Twas the ſame Paſſions induced a great. Aſſembly, conſiſting of <hi>Annas</hi> the High Prieſt, <hi>Caiaphas, John, Alexander,</hi> and all thoſe who were a kin to the High Prieſt, to ſpeak thus; <hi>What ſhall we do with theſe Men? for that indeed a notable Miracle hath been done by them, is manifeſt to all them that dwell in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and we cannot deny it.</hi>

                        <p>All theſe great Men pronounced both an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and an unjuſt Judgment, becauſe they were agitated by their Paſſions, and blinded by their falſe Zeal. They durſt not puniſh the Apoſtles becauſe of the People, and becauſe the Man who had been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly cured, was above 40 years old, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Aſſembly; But threatened them to hinder 'em from preaching in the Name of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they ought to condemn a Doctrine, whoſe Author they had put to death, <hi>You intend,</hi> ſay they to the Apoſtles, <hi>to bring this Man's Blood upon us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When falſe Zeal is joined to Hatred,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts</hi> c. 5.</note> it ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it from the reproaches of Reaſon, and after ſuch a manner juſtifies it that we do not ſcruple to follow its motions; and when ignorance and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs accompany fear, they extend to an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſubjects, and ſo well fortifie its emotions, that the leaſt ſuſpicion frightens and diſturbs the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                        <p>Falſe Zealors think they do God ſervice when they ſubmit to their Paſſions; they blindly follow the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret motions of their Hatred, as proceeding from the Internal Truth; and ſtopping with ſatisfaction at ſuch ſenſible proofs as juſtifie their exceſs, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm themſelves in their errors with an unconquerable obſtinacy.</p>
                        <p>As for Ignorant and Weak Perſons they create to themſelves ridiculous and imaginary ſubjects of fear; and like Children, who walk in the dark without a guide, they imagine frightful Bugbears, are diſturb'd and cry out as if they were undone; light re-aſſures them if they are ignorant, but if Men have weak Minds, their imagination is always diſturbed: The leaſt thing which relates to that frightful Object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the traces and courſe of the Spirits which cauſes the ſymtom of their fear; ſo that 'tis abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to cure or appeaſe them for ever.</p>
                        <p>But when falſe Zeal meets with Hatred and Fear, in a weak Mind, it continually produces ſuch unjuſt and violent Judgments in it, that we cannot think on 'em without horror. To change the Mind poſſeſſed with theſe Paſſions requires a greater Miracle than
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107782:61"/>that which converted St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and to cure it would be abſolute impoſſible, if we could ſet bounds to the Mercy and Power of God.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who walk in the dark rejoyce at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of light, but this Man cannot endure it, ſince it hurts him, becauſe it reſiſts his Paſſion. His fear being in ſome manner voluntary, becauſe 'tis produced by his hatred, he loves to be affected by it, ſince we love to be agitated by thoſe Paſſions which have Evil for their Object, when the Evil is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; or rather, when we know as in Tragedies, that the Evil can't hurt us.</p>
                        <p>The Phantoms that theſe form to themſelves who walk in the dark, vaniſh at the approach of light: But this Man's Phantoms cannot be diſſipated by the light of the truth; for inſtead of diſſipating the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Mind, it only incenſes his imagination; ſo that whilſt he applies himſelf to the Object of his Paſſion the light reflects, and it ſeems to him as if theſe Phantoms had real Bodies, ſince they reflect ſome weak rays of light which ſtrike upon them.</p>
                        <p>But if we ſhould ſuppoſe in theſe Perſons a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient docility and reflection to make 'em liſten to, and apprehend ſuch Reaſons as are capable of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating their Errors, yet their imagination being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered through fear, and their Hearts corrupted through hatred and falſe zeal, theſe Reaſons, how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid ſoever they might be in themſelves, would not be able long to ſtop the impetuous motions of theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſions, nor hinder them from ſpeedily juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves by ſenſible and convincing proofs.</p>
                        <p>For we muſt obſerve that there are ſome Paſſions which never return again, whereas there are others that are conſtant and durable. Thoſe which are not maintained by the ſight of the Mind, but only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and fortified by the ſenſible view of ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the fermentation of the Blood continue not, but commonly die immediately after they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. But thoſe which are attended with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Mind are laſting; for the Principle which cauſes them is not ſubject to change like the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107782:61"/>Blood and Humours. So that Hatred, Fear, and all the reſt of the Paſſions which are ſtirr'd up or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the knowledge of the Mind, and not by the ſenſible ſight of ſome Evil, muſt neceſſarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt long. Theſe Paſſions are therefore more durable, violent, and unjuſt, but not more lively and ſenſible, as has already been ſhown.</p>
                        <p>The perception of Good and Evil, which excite the Paſſions, is produced three ſeveral ways, by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Imagination, and the Mind. The perception of Good and Evil by the Senſes, or Senſation of Good and Evil, produces the quickeſt and moſt ſenſible Paſſions; Good and Evil perceived by the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, excites them after a much weaker manner; and the perception of Good and Evil by the Mind purely, never produces true ones, becauſe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with ſome motion of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                        <p>The Paſſions are given us only for the good of the Body, and by that to unite us to all ſenſible things; for although ſenſible things can be neither good or bad in reſpect to the Mind, they are ſo however in relation to the Body to which they are united. Thus the Senſes diſcovering much better the relation that ſenſible Objects have to the Body, than the Mind it ſelf can: They muſt excite much more lively Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions than a clear and evident knowledge is able to do. But becauſe all our diſcoveries are attended with ſome motion of the Spirits, a clear and evident knowledge of a great Good and great Evil, which is not perceived by the Senſes, always excites ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>Yet all our clear and evident diſcoveries of Good and Evil, are not followed by ſome ſenſible Paſſion which we perceive; and ſo on the other ſide all our Paſſions are not attended with ſome knowledge of the Mind. For, if we ſometimes think of Good and Evil without feeling our ſelves moved, we often find our ſelves moved with ſome Paſſions without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they are, nay ſometimes without perceiving the cauſe of 'em. One who breaths in a good Air
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107782:62"/>feels a motion of Joy, without knowing from whence it proceeds, or what good 'tis he poſſeſſes which cauſes this Joy. And if there is any inviſible Body which mingles with the Blood, and hinders its fermentation, it will produce ſorrow; and perhaps he will attribute the cauſe of his ſorrow to any viſible thing which occurs in that moment of his Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>Of all the Paſſions none are more ſenſible, or more quick, and conſequently leſs attended with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Mind, than horrour and antipathy, agreeableneſs and ſympathy. It ſometimes happens that a Man ſleeping under a ſhady Tree would of a ſuddain and unexpectedly be waked at the ſting of a Gnat, or tickling of a Leaf, even as if he were bitten with a Serpent. The confuſed Senſation of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as terrible as death frights him, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he is agitated with a moſt powerful and violent Paſſion, which is an averſion of deſire. On the contrary, a Man in ſome neceſſity by chance diſcovers a ſmall good, the ſatisfaction of which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes him, and he applies himſelf to this trifle as to the greateſt good imaginable, without making the leaſt reflexion upon it: The like alſo happens in the motions of ſympathy and antipathy. We ſometimes ſee a certain Perſon, whoſe habit and external appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance has ſome ſecret alliance with the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our Body, we are forthwith touched with a vehement inclination for him, and without any reflexion, are induced to love and wiſh him well: 'Tis this, <hi>I know not what,</hi> which agitates us, ſince Reaſon has no ſhare in it: And the contrary happens in reſpect to thoſe, whoſe Air and Manners excite diſguſt and horrour in us; They have, I know not what, diſagreeableneſs which ſhocks and terrifies, but the Mind perceives it not, ſince the Senſes are the only proper Judges of ſenſible Beauty and Deformity, which are the Objects of theſe ſorts of Paſſions.</p>

                        <p>IN the preceding Books we have ſeen how ſubject to Error the Mind of Man is; that he is deceived every Moment by the Illuſions of his<note n="(a)" place="margin">Book 1.</note> Senſes, the<note n="(b)" place="margin">Book 2.</note> Viſions of his Imagination, and Abſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note n="(c)" place="margin">Book 3.</note> of his Mind, that the Inclinations<note n="(d)" place="margin">Book 4.</note> of his Will, and his<note n="(e)" place="margin">Book 5.</note> Paſſions are a Means to obſcure the Truth, and never ſuffer it to appear, except it has a Tincture of thoſe falſe Colours which flatter Concupiſcence. In a word, we have in part diſcovered the Errors of the Mind, and their Cauſes: It is now Time to ſhow
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107782:63"/>the Way which will conduct us to the Knowledge of the Truth, and give the Mind all the Power and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we can, to enable it to keep this Way, without either ſtraying, or vainly fatiguing it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>But to avoid giving the Reader any unneceſſary Trouble in the Peruſal of this laſt Book; I think fit to advertiſe him, that 'tis only writ for thoſe, that wou'd, of themſelves, ſeriouſly enquire into Truth; and to this end employ the utmoſt Power of their own Minds. I would have them for a time lay aſide all probable Opinions, and hot rely on the ſtrongeſt Conjectures; but neglect the Authority of all Philoſophers, and as much as poſſible, divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Prejudices, Self-love and Paſſions: Very much diſtruſting their Senſes and Imaginations: And in fine, that they well remember the greateſt Part of thoſe things that have been told them in the preceding Books.</p>
                        <p>The Deſign of this laſt Book is an Endeavour to help the Mind to all the Perfection it is naturally capable of, by furniſhing it with whatſoever is neceſſary to render it more capacious and attentive; and in preſcribing ſuch Rules as muſt be obſerved in an Enquiry after Truth, to prevent its being ever deceived, and to teach it, in ſome time Time, all that can be known.</p>
                        <p>If we were to carry this Deſign to its utmoſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which we pretend not to do, ſince this is only an Eſſay; it might be ſaid, That we ought to have given an univerſal Science, that thoſe that wou'd have made uſe of it, might have been truly learned; ſince they wou'd have had the Foundation of all particular Sciences, and acquired them proportionably to the uſe they had made of this univerſal one. For we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, by this Treatiſe, to make the Mind capable of forming true and certain Judgments upon all Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions which ſhall be proportioned to it.</p>
                        <p>As a Memory that is able to retain all the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of <hi>Euclid, Archimedes, Pappus, Apollonius,</hi> and all that have writ of Geometry, is not ſuffic ent to make a Man a good Geometrician; ſo neither is it enough to have read <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Deſcartes,</hi>
                           <pb n="131" facs="tcp:107782:63"/>and perfectly to know their Sentiments about Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, to make a Man a learned Philoſopher. The Knowledge of all the Opinions and Judgments of other Men, whether Philoſophers or Geometricians, cannot ſo properly be called a Science as an Hiſtory: For true Science, which alone can give the Mind of Man that Perfection it is now capable of, conſiſts in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ability to judge ſolidly of all things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to it. But not to loſe Time, and to prevent the prejudicing any Perſon by precipitated Judgments, we will begin to treat of this important Matter.</p>
                        <p>We muſt firſt call to mind the Rule that has been proved and eſtabliſhed in the beginning of the firſt Book, becauſe it is the Foundation and chief Principle of whatſoever we ſhall hereafter ſay; therefore I'll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it: <hi>We ought never to give our intire Aſſent, except to ſuch Propoſitions as appear ſo evidently true, that we cannot refuſe it them, without feeling ſome inward Pain, and ſecret Reproaches of our Reaſon; that is, without a clear knowledge, that we ſhould make an ill uſe of our Liberty, if we would not give our Aſſent.</hi> Every Time we aſſent to Probabilities, we put our ſelves into a certain Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being deceived, and are almoſt always actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived; and if we are not, 'tis a mere Effect of Chance and Good Fortune. Thus a confuſed Sight of a great Number of Probabilities upon different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, can never add any Perfection to our Reaſon; for 'tis only a clear Sight of the Truth, that can give either that, or any ſolid Satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>The Concluſion therefore is very plain, That Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence only, according to our firſt Rule, can ſecure us from being deceived: We ought above all things, to be very careful to preſerve this Evidence in all our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, that we may be able to make a ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whatſoever may be ſubmitted to our Reaſon, and to diſcover all the Truths we are capable of.</p>
                        <p>Such things as can either produce or preſerve this Evidence, are of two Sorts. Some of which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or in ſome manner depending on us; and others which have no Connection with us. For to ſee Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects diſtinctly, it is neceſſary to have a good Sight,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107782:64"/>and to give a good Attention to theſe Objects, and both theſe are within us, or in ſome manner depend upon us: A good Underſtanding is likewiſe neceſſary, and a ſtrong Application for the penetrating into the Bottom of intelligible Truths; which alſo are either in, or in ſome manner depend upon us.</p>
                        <p>But as the Eye has need of Light to ſee, and this Light depends upon external Cauſes: The Mind alſo has need of Idea's to conceive; and theſe Idea's as has been elſewhere proved, depend not upon us, but on an external Cauſe, which furniſhes us with them. If therefore it ſhou'd happen, that ſome Idea's of things were not preſented to our Minds, every time that we wiſhed to have them; and if he who enlightens the World, wou'd conceal them from us, 'twou'd be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to remedy it, and to know any thing, even as it is impoſſible for us to ſee Objects without Light. But we ſhall never have any reaſon to fear it; for the Preſence of Idea's to our Mind being natural, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the general Will of God, which is always conſtant and immoveable, we can never fail of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſuch things as are naturally ſubjected to our Reaſon. For the Sun that enlightens the Mind, is not like the Sun that enlightens the Body: It is never eclipſed, and it penetrates every thing without having its Light divided.</p>
                        <p>The Idea's of all things being therefore continually preſent to us, even when we do not conſider them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, there is nothing requiſite in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Evidence in all our Perceptions, but to find a means of making our Minds more attentive and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: So to be able well to diſtinguiſt ſuch viſible Objects as are preſented to us, it is neceſſary, on our Part, to have a good Sight, and to conſider them ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly:</p>
                        <p>But becauſe the Objects that we conſider, have often more Relations than we can be able to diſcover at one View, by a ſimple Effort of the Mind: We have yet need of ſome Rules, to aſſiſt us in the diſentangling all Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſo well, that being helpt by thoſe Rules which will make our Mind more attentive and capacious,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107782:64"/>we diſcover, with an intire Evidence, all the Relations of thoſe things that we examine.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall therefore divide this Book into two Parts. In the firſt we ſhall treat of the Helps the Mind may make uſe of to become more attentive and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious: And in the ſecond, give thoſe Rules that ought to be followed in the Enquiry after Truth, to form ſolid Judgments thereof, without Fear of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Attention is neceſſary to preſerve Evidence in all our Perceptions, that the Modifications of the Soul make it attentive, but do much divide its Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Perception.</head>
                        <p>WE have ſhewed in the Beginning of this Work, That the Underſtanding only perceives, and that in reſpect to the Underſtanding there is no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwen ſimple Perceptions, Judgments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, except that Judgments and Reaſonings are much more compound than ſimple Perceptions are; becauſe they do not only repreſent many things, but even the Relations that theſe things have amongſt themſelves. For ſimple Perceptions only repreſent things to the Mind; but Judgments repreſent to the Mind the Relations that are betwixt theſe things; and ſimple Reaſonings repreſent the Relations which are between the Relations of things: But compound Reaſonings repreſent the Relations of Relations, or the compound Relations which are between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of things, and ſo on <hi>ad Infinitum.</hi> For whilſt theſe Relations are multiplied, the Reaſonings which repreſent them to the Mind become more compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But Judgments, ſimple and compound Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are only pure Perceptions, in reſpect to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107782:65"/>becauſe the Underſtanding only ſimply perceives, as has been before intimated.</p>
                        <p>Thus Judgments and Reaſonings, as to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, being pure Perceptions: It is plain that the Underſtanding never falls into any Error; ſince there is none in Perceptions, neither is Error ſo much as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. For, as we have often ſaid already, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in a precipitate Conſent of the Will, which ſuffers it ſelf to be dazled by ſome falſe Light, and inſtead of preſerving its Liberty as long as it can, negligently relies on the Appearance of Truth.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, ſince it commonly happens that the Underſtanding hath only confuſed and imperfect Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of things, we may ſay it is certainly the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Cauſe of our Errors. For as our Eyes often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us, becauſe they repreſent external Objects ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confuſed and imperfectly to us: Confuſed when they are too diſtant from us, or for want of a due Light; and imperfectly, becauſe they only repreſent to us thoſe Sides which are towards us: So the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding having often only a confuſed, and imperfect Idea of things, becauſe they are not ſufficiently repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it, and becauſe it diſcovers not all their Parts, cauſes the Will to fall into a great Number of Errors, in yielding too eaſily to theſe obſcure and imperfect Perceptions.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore neceſſary to find ſome means to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Perceptions from being confuſed and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and becauſe nothing can make them more clear and diſtinct than Attention, which all the World is convinced of; our Care muſt be to find ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as will make us become more attentive than we yet are. This will be a Way to preſerve Evidence in all our Reaſonings, and make us able, at one View, to perceive a neceſſary Connection between all the Parts of our longeſt Deductions.</p>
                        <p>In order to find this means, 'tis neceſſary that we ſhou'd be well convinced of what has already been ſaid elſewhere, That the Mind carries not an equal Attention to every thing it perceives; for it applies it ſelf infinitely more to thoſe that affect, modifie, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107782:65"/>penetrate it, than to thoſe that are preſent to it, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it not, nor belong to it. And in fine, it imploys it ſelf much more about its own Modifications, than about the ſimple Idea's of Objects, which are ſomething different from it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>This is the Reaſon that with ſome Uneaſineſs, and without much Application, we conſider the abſtracted Idea's of the pure Underſtanding, and apply our ſelves much more to ſuch things as fall under our Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially if our Imagination is ſtrong enough to make deep Traces in our Brain: And indeed, it is the Cauſe why we entirely employ our ſelves about ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualities, even without being able to apply our ſelves to the pure Idea's of the Mind, whilſt we feel any thing that's either very agreeable or very painful. for Pain, Pleaſure, and the reſt of the Senſations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Modifications of the Mind, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that we ſhou'd exiſt and not perceive them, and that the Capacity of our Mind ſhou'd not be employed about them, ſince our Senſations are only ſimple Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
                        <p>But it is not the ſame with the pure Idea's of the Mind; ſince they may be intimately united to it, without conſidering them with the leaſt Attention. For although God be moſt intimately united to us, and comprehends the Ideas of whatſoever we ſee: Yet theſe Idea's, though preſent and within our ſelves, are hid from us, when the Motions of the Spirits ſtir up no Traces of them, or when our Will applies not our Mind thereto; I mean when it forms no Acts to which the Repreſentation of theſe Idea's are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected by the Author of Nature. This is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whatſoever we ſhall propoſe about ſuch Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as may render our Minds more attentive, ſo that theſe Helps will be founded upon the very Nature of the Mind, and there is ſome Reaſon to hope they will not be ſo chimerical and uſeleſs as many others, which more perplex than aſſiſt the Mind.</p>
                        <p>But if they are not ſo uſeful as might be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the Time that is imployed about the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them will not be loſt, ſince by it the Reader
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107782:66"/>will be better acquainted with the Nature of his Mind.</p>
                        <p>The Modifications of the Soul have three Cauſes; the Senſes, Imagination and Paſſions: Every one knows by his own Experience, that Pleaſures, Pains, and in general, all Senſations, ſtrong Imaginations, and great Paſſions, ſo much poſſeſs their Mind, that it is not capable of Attention, when it is too livelily touched by theſe things; becauſe then its Capacity or Faculty of perceiving is wholly filled. And although theſe Modifications ſhou'd be moderated, they wou'd nevertheleſs in ſome manner divide the Capacity of the Mind, ſo that it cou'd not wholly imploy it ſelf in conſidering the Truth of things that are never ſo little abſtracted.</p>
                        <p>It will be neceſſary to draw this important Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That all thoſe that wou'd ſeriouſly apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Search after Truth, ought to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſhun, as much as poſſible, all ſtrong Senſations, as a great Noiſe, too brisk a Light, Pleaſure, Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and continually to ſtir up the Purity of their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prevent its making in their Brain ſuch deep Traces as continually diſquiet and diſſipate the Mind. And above all, to put a Stop to the Motions of their Paſſions, which cauſe ſuch powerful Impreſſions in the Body and Soul, that 'tis generally impoſſible the Mind ſhou'd think of any thing elſe. For although the pure Idea's of Truth are always preſent to us, we cannot conſider them, when the Capacity we have of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is filled with theſe Modifications which poſſeſs us.</p>
                        <p>However, as it is impoſſible that the Soul ſhou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt without Paſſion, Senſation, or any other particular Modification: We muſt make a Virtue of Neceſſity, and even draw from theſe Modifications ſome Helps to render us more attentive. Yet muſt we make uſe of much Artifice and Circumſpection in the applying theſe Helps to gain ſome Advantage from them. The need we have of them muſt be well examined, and we muſt only make uſe of 'em ſo far as the Neceſſity of rendring our ſelves attentive conſtrains us to.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the uſe that may be made of the Paſſions and Senſes, to preſerve the Attention of the Mind.</head>
                        <p>THE Paſſions which it is neceſſary for us to make uſe of to excite us to an Enquiry after Truth, are thoſe that give us Strength and Courage enough to ſurmount all the Trouble we may meet with in endeavouring to render our ſelves attentive, ſome of which are good and ſome bad; of which the good are a Deſire to find the Truth, to acquire a ſufficient Knowledge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct our ſelves, to render us uſeful to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſome others of the like Nature: But the bad or dangerous ones are ſuch as a deſire to acquire Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to make ſome Eſtabliſhment of our Fortune, to raiſe our ſelves above our Neighbours, and ſome others that are yet more irregular, of which it is not neceſſary to ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>In the unhappy Eſtate we now are in, it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the moſt unreaſonable Paſſions do moſt powerfully excite us to ſearch after the Truth, and give us a more agreeable Satisfaction for all the Pains we take in our Purſuit, than the moſt juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Paſſions do. Vanity, for inſtance, excites us much more than the Love of Truth; and we every Day ſee ſome continually applying themſelves to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when they find Perſons to whom they may relate what they have learnt; but who intirely abandon their Studies when they have not an Opportunity to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Acquirements. The confuſed Proſpect of ſome Glory they gain when they put off their Opinons, maintains their Courage in the moſt barren and tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Studies. But if by Chance or Neceſſity of their Affairs, they find themſelves far diſtant from their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flock of Admirers, their Ardour is ſoon cooled, and even the moſt ſolid Studies cannot attract them: Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, Weariſomneſs, and Chagriu ſeizes them, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107782:67"/>they quit all. Vanity triumphs over their natural La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs, but Lazineſs in its turn triumphs over the Love of Truth, for Vanity ſometimes reſiſts Idleneſs, but Idleneſs is generally victorious over the Love of Truth.</p>
                        <p>Yet the Paſſion for Gloty may be ſubſervient to a good End, ſince we may make uſe of it for the Glory of God and the Profit of others: Some Perſons may be permitted, on ſeveral Occaſions, to make uſe of this Paſſion as an Help to make the Mind more attentive; but we muſt take great Care to uſe it only when thoſe reaſonable Paſſions we have already mentioned, are not ſufficient; and when our Duty obliges us to apply our ſelves to ſuch Subjects as we are diſcouraged from. Firſt, becauſe this Paſſion is very dangerous in reſpect of the Conſcience: Secondly, becauſe it inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly engages us in unprofitable Studies, which have a more tempting Appearance than either Uſefulneſs or Truth in them: In fine, becauſe this Paſſion is very difficult to be moderated, we are often abuſed by it; and while we believe our Mind is illuminated by it, we often ſtrengthen our Concupiſcence; which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupts the Heart, but diſperſes ſuch a Darkneſs through the Mind as is morally impoſſible to be diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated.</p>
                        <p>We ought to conſider that this Paſſion is inſenſibly encreaſed, fortified, and eſtabliſhed in the Heart of Man; and that when it is too violent, inſtead of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Mind in a Search after Truth, it ſtrangely blinds it, and makes it believe things, even as it wiſhes them to be.</p>
                        <p>Without doubt, we ſhou'd not have met with ſo many falſe Inventions and imaginary Diſcoveries, if Men had not ſuffered their Brains to be diſordered by their Zeal of appearing Inventers. For the firm and obſtinate Perſwaſion many Men have had, that they have found, for inſtance, the perpetual Motion, the ſquaring of the Circle, and Duplication of the Cube by common Geometry, has apparently proceeded from the great Deſire they had of appearing to have effected what many Perſons had unſucceſsfully attempted.</p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:107782:67"/>
                        <p>It is therefore better to excite thoſe Paſſions in us which are ſo much the more uſeful in the Search after Truth, as they are more ſtrong, and in the Exceſs of which there is leaſt to be feared; as the Deſires of making a good uſe of our Wit; of delivering our ſelves from Prejudices and Errors; of acquiring ſo much Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as will enable us to conduct our ſelves through whatſoever Condition we are in, and other the like Paſſions; which engage us not in unuſeful Studies, nor incline us to make too precipitate Judgments.</p>
                        <p>When we begin to taſte the Pleaſure that is found in the Exerciſe of the Mind, diſcover the Advantage that recurs from it, deſtroy thoſe violent Paſſions, and diſdainfully reject thoſe ſenſible Pleaſures, which, whilſt we imprudently permit them to tyrannize over our Reaſon, we have no need of any other Paſſions than thoſe we have before mentioned, to make us at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive upon whatſoever Subject we wou'd conſider.</p>
                        <p>But the Generality of Mankind are not in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. They have no good Reliſh of any thing but only what touches the Senſes. Their Imagination is corrupted with an almoſt infinite Number of deep Traces, which only ſtir up falſe Idea's: For they are united to every thing that falls under the Senſes and Imagination, and judge always according to the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they have received from them, in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to themſelves. Pride, Debauchery, Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unquiet Deſires to raiſe their Fortune, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſcure the Diſcovery of Truth in the Men of this World, that it ſtifles in them the Sentiments of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; becauſe they ſeparate them from God, who only can enlighten us, as he only can govern us. For we cannot encreaſe our Union with ſenſible things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminiſhing that which we have with intellectual Truths: Since in the ſame Time we cannot be ſo ſtrictly united to things that are ſo different and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe therefore who have a pure and chaſte Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I mean ſuch whoſe Brain is not filled with deep Traces, which unite them to ſenſible things, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be united to God, and be made attentive to the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107782:68"/>Truth which ſpeaks to them: The moſt juſt and moſt reaſonable Paſſions will be ſufficient to determine ſuch Perſons. But thoſe that live in the World who are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to too many things, and whoſe Imagination is ſpoiled by falſe and obſcure Idea's, which ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have excited in them, cannot apply themſelves to the Truth, if they are not born up by ſome Paſſion that is ſtrong enough to counterballance the violent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Body which draws them aſide, and to form ſuch Traces in their Brain as may be capable of making a Revulſion in the Animal Spirits. But as all Paſſion of it ſelf can only confound Idea's, they ought to make no more uſe of them than Neceſſity requires, and all Men ought ſo to ſtudy themſelves, as may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to proportion their Paſſions to their own Weakneſſes.</p>
                        <p>It is not difficult to find ſome means of exciting ſuch Paſſions in our ſelves as we wiſh. The Knowledge we have given of the Union of the Soul and Body, in the preceding Books, affords a ſufficient means to accompliſh it: For, in a Word, 'tis enough to think attentively upon ſuch Objects, which according to the Inſtitution or Natture are capable of exciting the Paſſions. Thus we may almoſt always raiſe ſuch Paſſions in our Hearts as we have Occaſion for: But though we can ſo eaſily cauſe them, we cannot always ſo eaſily extirpate them, nor remedy the Diſorders that they cauſe in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and therefore we ought to uſe them with great Moderation.</p>
                        <p>Above all things, we muſt be cautious that we do not Judge of things by our Paſſion, but only by a clear Sight of Truth, which it is almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to obſerve, when the Paſſions are a little vigorous. Paſſion ought only to ſerve us to ſtir up our Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but it always produces its own Idea's, and it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obliges the Will to judge of things by theſe Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's that affect it, rather than by the pure and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Idea's of the Truth, which affect it not. So that ſuch Judgments are often formed, which laſt no longer than the Paſſion it ſelf, becauſe it is not a clear Sight of the immutable Truth, but the Circulation of the Blood which produces them.</p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:107782:68"/>
                        <p>It is certain, that Men are ſtrangely obſtinate in their Errors, and that they generally maintain them all their Lives. But either theſe Errors have often other Cauſes than the Paſſions, or elſe they depend upon certain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Paſſions, which proceed from the Conformation of the Body, Intereſt, or ſome other Cauſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues a long Time. Intereſt, for inſtance, indures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, it creates a Paſſion which never dies, and the Judgment that theſe Paſſions form are very laſting. But all other Sentiments of Men, which depend upon particular Paſſions, are as inconſtant as the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Humours are. They ſpeak ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one manner, and ſometimes after another; and What they ſay is generally conformable to what they think. They run from one falſe Good to another as falſe, by the Motion of their Paſſion, which they again diſlike as ſoon as this Paſſion ceaſes. So alſo they run from one falſe Syſtem to another. They ardently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a falſe Notion, when their Paſſion renders it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; but this Paſſion being once extinguiſht, they abandon it. They taſte of every Good by their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without finding any thing that is really ſo: And by the ſame Paſſions they ſee all Trtuths, without diſcovering any: Although, whilſt the Paſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, what they taſte appears to them to be the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Good; and what they ſee, ſeems to them to be an indiſputable Truth.</p>
                        <p>The Second Source, from whence we may draw any Helps to render the Mind attentive, is the Senſes. Senſations are the proper Modifications of the Soul, pure Idea's of the Mind are ſomething different: Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. then ſtir up our Attention in a much more lively manner than pure Idea's do; ſo that it is plain we may remedy this Defect of the Application of the Mind to Truths that do not affect us, in expreſſing them by ſenſible things which do.</p>
                        <p>Ths is the Reaſon that Geometers expreſs the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between thoſe Magnitudes they wou'd conſider by ſenſible Lines. By drawing Lines upon Paper, they trace, if I may ſo ſay, the Idea's upon their Minds which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them: They make them more familiar to them,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107782:69"/>becauſe they ſee them in the ſame Time they wou'd conceive them. After this manner many things that are difficult enough in themſelves, might be taught to Children, who are not capable of abſtracted Truths, becauſe of the Tenderneſs of the Fibres of their Brain. They ſee only with their Eyes Colours, Pictures, Images; but with the Mind they conſider not the Idea's which anſwer to theſe Senſible Objects.</p>
                        <p>A particular Care muſt be taken not to obſcure Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that we wou'd conſider our ſelves, or diſcover to others with ſo much Senſibility, leſt the Mind ſhou'd be more taken up with it than with the Truth it ſelf, which is a very conſiderable and common Fault. We every Day ſee Orators, who apply themſelves only to that which affects the Senſes, and who expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after ſo ſenſible a manner, that the Truth is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtifled under the Weight of their vain Ornaments and falſe Eloquence. So that thoſe who hear them, being much more touched with the Meaſure of their Periods, and Motions of their Figures, than by their Arguments, ſuffer themſelves to be overcome, without either knowing what perſwades them, or of what they are perſwaded.</p>
                        <p>Much Care therefore ought to be taken ſo to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Senſibility of our Expreſſions, that they may only render the Mind more attentive. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo beautiful as the Truth, we cannot pretend to render it finer by painting it with ſome Senſible Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which have nothing ſolid in them, and can only charm for a little Time. Perhaps we might give it ſome pretty Strokes, but we ſhou'd diminiſh its Strength; we ought not to cloath it ſo bright and ſparkling as to make the Mind more attentive to its Ornaments, than to the Truth it ſelf: It wou'd be to treat it like certain Perſons who load themſelves with ſo much Gold and precious Stones, that at laſt they appear the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable thing in the Figure they make.</p>
                        <p>Truth ought to be cloathed like the Magiſtrates of <hi>Venice,</hi> who are obliged to wear ſuch a ſimple Robe, and a Cap, as may only diſtinguiſh them from other Men, that they may look upon them with Attention
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107782:69"/>and Reſpect, rather than their Apparel. And indeed, Care muſt be taken not to give it too great a Train of agreeable things, that will only ſerve to diſſipate the Mind, and hinder it from diſcovering it, leſt we ſhou'd give to ſomething elſe the Honours that are only due to that: As ſometimes happens to Princes, that we ſee amongſt a great Number of Courtiers which are about them, and who partake too much of that Great and Majeſtick Air as is only fit for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns.</p>
                        <p>But to give a greater Example: I ſay that Truth muſt be ſo manifeſted by others as it hath manifeſted it ſelf. All Men, ſince the Fall of their firſt Parents, have too weak a Sight to conſider Truth in it ſelf, therefore the Sovereign Truth has rendred it ſelf ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by taking upon it our Humanity, that it may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract our Thoughts, enlighten us, and make it ſelf amiable in our Eyes. Thus by its Example we may cover With any ſenſible thing thoſe Truths that we wou'd comprehend our ſelves, or teach to others, Co that we may attract the Mind, which loves what is ſenſible, and which is not eaſily taken with any thing that does not flatter the Senſes. The Eternal Wiſdom has made it ſelf Senſible, but not Reſplendent: It is become ſenſible, not to make us acquieſce in ſenſible things, but to raiſe us to intelligible things: It became ſenſible to condemn and ſacrifice in its own Perſon all ſenſible things; we ought therefore in our Purſuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Truth, to make uſe of ſuch ſenſible things as da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle not too much, or ſtop us at the Senſible Part: But ſuch as can only maintain the Preſence of our Minds in the Contemplation of Truths purely intelligible: Such ſenſible things we muſt make uſe of, as we can diſſipate, annihilate, or ſacrifice with Pleaſure, as ſoon as we ſhall have diſcovered thoſe Truths for which we made uſe of it.

                        <p>GReat Circumſpection muſt be uſed in the Choice and Uſe of ſuch Helps as may be drawn from our Paſſions and Senſes to render us attentive to Truth: Becauſe our Paſſions and Senſes too livelily affect us, and after ſuch a manner fill the Capacity of the Mind, that we often ſee only our own Senſations when we think we have diſcovered the things themſelves that we ſought for; but it is not the ſame with thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that may be drawn from the Imagination. They make the Mind become attentive without fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly dividing its Capacity, and ſo wonderfully aſſiſt us to perceive Objects clearly and diſtinctly, that 'tis, for the moſt part, beneficial to make uſe of them. But we ſhall make this plain by ſome Inſtances.</p>
                        <p>We know that a Body is moved by two or many different Cauſes, towards two or many different Places; that theſe Forces impel it equally or unequally, that they encreaſe or diminiſh continually, according to ſuch a continued Proportion. And it may be demanded what is the Line this Body ought to move in, the Place it muſt be in ſuch a Moment, what its Swiftneſs when arrived to ſuch a Place, and other things of the like Nature?</p>

                        <p>From the Point A, where ſuppoſe it to be when this Body begins to move, draw the indefinite Lines A B,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107782:71"/>A C, which make the Angle B A C, iſ they cut each other: for A B and A C are direct, and cut not each other, when the Motions they expreſs are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite. After this manner is diſtinctly repreſented to the Imagination, or if you will, to the Senſes, the Way that this Body wou'd follow, if there was only one of theſe forces which puſhed it towards one of theſe Sides C or B.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the Force which moves this Body towards B, is equal to that which moves it towards C; we muſt divide the Lines A B and A C into the Parts 1, 2, 3, 4, and I, II, III, IV, equally diſtant from A. If the Force which moves it towards B is double to that which moves it towards C, then take the Parts in A B double to thoſe that are in A C. If this Force is ſubduple, they muſt be taken ſubduple: If three times greater or leſs, they muſt be taken propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably. The Diviſion of theſe Lines furthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> expreſs to the Imagination, the Magnitude of the different Powers which move theſe Bodies, and in the ſame Time the Space they ſhall cauſe the Body to run through.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Through theſe Diviſions draw Parallels upon A B, and A C, to have the Lines, 1 X, 2 X, 3 X, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> equal to A I, A II, A III, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I X, II X, III X, equal to A 1, A 2, A 3. which expreſs the Spaces that theſe Forces are capable of cauſing this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to run through, and through the Interſection of theſe Parallels, draw the Line A X Y E, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to the Imagination, firſt, the true Magnitude of the compound Motion of this Body, that in the ſame time we conceive to be puſhed towards B, and towards C, by two different Forces, according to ſuch or ſuch a Proportion. Secondly, the Way it ought to keep: In fine, every Place where it muſt be in ſuch a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Time, ſo that this Line ſerves, not only to maintain the Preſence of the Mind in the Enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all Truths that we wou'd diſcover concerning the Queſtion propoſed: But even repreſents the Reſolution after a very ſenſible and convincing manner.</p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:107782:71"/>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">See the firſt Figures.</note>Firſt, This Line A X Y E, expreſſes the true Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the compound Motion; for we ſee ſenſibly, if the Forces that produce it, can each make this Body advance a Foot in a Minute, its compound Motion ſhall be two Foot in a Minute, if the compounding Motions perfectly agree. For in this caſe it ſuffices to add A B to A C; and if theſe Motions do not entirely agree, the compounded A C ſhall be greater than one of the compounding A B or A C, by the Line Y E. But if theſe Motions are oppoſite in any thing, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded will be leſs than either of the compounding by the Line Y E, and if they are intirely oppoſite, it will be nothing at all.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This Line A X Y E repreſents to the Imagination the Way that this Body ought to follow; and ſenſibly ſhows, according to what Proportion it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances more on one Side than another. It is evident alſo that all the compounded Motions are right, when each of the compounding is always the ſame, although they be unequal amongſt themſelves, or elſe when the compounding are equal amongſt themſelves, altho' they are not always the ſame. In fine, it is viſible that the Lines which deſcribe theſe Motions, are Curves, when the compounding are unequal amongſt themſelves, and are not always the ſame.</p>
                        <p>This Line further repreſents to the Imagination all the Places where this Body, puſhed by two different Forces to two different Places, will be found: So that we may preciſely mark the Point this Body muſt be in at what Inſtant of Time we pleaſe. For inſtance, If we wou'd know where it wou'd be in the Beginning of the fourth Minute: We only need divide the Lines A B or A C, into ſuch Parts as expreſs the Space that theſe known Forces will each of them be capable of making this Body run through in a Minute, and take off three of theſe Parts in ſome one of theſe Lines, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the Beginning of the fourth; draw 3 X, parallel to A B or III X parallel to A C. For it is evident that the Point X, which one or other of theſe Parallels determine in the Line A X Y E, marks the Place where this Body will be in the Beginning of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107782:72"/>third Minute of its Motion. Thus this Method of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining Queſtions does not only maintain the Preſence of the Mind, but even ſhows it the Reſolution thereof, and gives it a ſufficient Light to diſcover things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, by the Help of a very few of thoſe that are known.</p>
                        <p>It is ſufficient, for Inſtance, after what has been ſaid that we only know that a Body which was in the Point A, in ſuch a Time, will be in E, in another Time; and that the different Forces puſh it by Lines, which make a given Angle, as B A C; to diſcover the Line of its compounded Motion, and the different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Velocities of ſimple Motions, provided we now theſe Motions to be uniform or equal amongſt themſelves. For when we have two Points of a right Line, we have the whole; and we may compare the right Line A E, or the compounded Motion which is known with the Lines A B and A C, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſimple Motions which are unknown.</p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:107782:72"/>
                        <figure>

                        <p>C, by an unequal Motion, like to that which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly believe Bodies weigh in their Tendency towards the Center of the Earth; that is, that the Spaces run through, are amongſt themſelves, as the <hi>Squares</hi> of the Times taken up in running through them: The Line which it will deſcribe will always be a <hi>Parabola;</hi> and we may determine with the greateſt Exactneſs where the Point will be in ſuch a Moment of its Motoin.</p>
                        <p>For if in the firſt Moment this Body falls two Foot from A to C, in the ſecond ſix, in the third ten, in the fourth fourteen, and be puſhed by an uniform Motion from A to B, which is ſixteen Foot long, it is plain that the Line which it will deſcribe will be a <hi>Parabola,</hi> whoſe <hi>Perameter</hi> will be eight Foot long. For the Square of the <hi>Ordinates</hi> to the Diameter, which mark the Times and regular Motion of A to B, will be equal to a Rect-angle of the <hi>Perameter</hi> into the Lines which mark the unequal and accelerated Motion; and the Squares of the <hi>Ordinates,</hi> that is, the Squares of the Times will be amongſt themſelves, as the Parts of the Diameter comprehended between the <hi>Vertex</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates:</hi> 16.64 ∷ 2.8, 64: 14 4 ∷ 8: 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is ſufficient to conſider the ſixth Figure to be Perſwaded of this. For the Semicircles ſhow that A 2, is to A 4, that is, to the <hi>Ordinate</hi> 2 X, which is equal to it, as 2 X is to A B. That A 18 is to A 12, that is, to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate 18 X, as 18 X, is to A 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles</hi> A 2 into A B, and A 18 into A 8; are equal to the Squares of 2 X, and 18 X, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe <hi>Squares</hi> are between themſelves, as theſe Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles are.</p>
                        <p>The Parallels upon A B and A C, which interſect one another in the Points X. X. X. likewiſe very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſcover the Way that this Body muſt keep; and mark the Places it ought to be in at ſuch a Time. In fine, they repreſent to the Eyes in a determined Time, both the true Magnitude of the compounded Motion, and of its Acceleration.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſe again that a Body is moved unequally from A to C, as well as from A to B: If the Inequality is alike both in the Beginning and all along, <hi>viz.</hi> if the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107782:73"/>Inequality of its Motion towards C is like to that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards B, or if it encreaſes in the ſame Proportion, the Line that it deſcribes will be right.</p>
                        <p>But if we ſuppoſe that there is ſome Inequality in the Increaſe or Diminution of ſimple Motions; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſuppoſe this Inequality what we pleaſe, it will be always eaſie to find the Line, which repreſents the compounded Motion of theſe ſimple Motions to the Imagination; in expreſſing theſe Motions by Lines, and drawing Parallels to theſe Lines which ſhall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect them. For the Line that ſhall paſs through all the Interſections of theſe Parallels, will repreſent the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Motion of theſe unequal Motions, and which are unequally <hi>accelerated</hi> or diminiſhed.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, if we ſuppoſe a Body be moved, by two equal or unequal Forces whatever, that one of theſe Motions continually increaſes or diminiſhes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any Geometrick or Arithmetick Progreſſion: And likewiſe that the other Motion increaſes or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes according to any Arithmetick or Geometrick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, to find the Points by which the Line muſt paſs that repreſents the Motion compounded of theſe two Motions both to the Eyes and Imagination.</p>
                        <figure>
                           <figDesc>diagram representing actual and imagined motion</figDesc>
                        </figure>
                        <p>As we have before intimated, we muſt firſt draw the two Lines A B and A C, to expreſs the two ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Motions, and divide theſe Lines according to the Computation of the <hi>Acceleration</hi> of theſe Motions. If
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107782:74"/>we ſuppoſe the Motion expreſſed by the Line A B, in, creaſes or diminiſhes according to this Arithmetick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, ∺ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, it muſt be divided in the Points marked, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: And if we ſuppoſe the Motion expreſſed by the Line A C, increaſes according to this continued Geometrick Progreſſion, ∺ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or diminiſhes according to this, 4, 2, 1, ½, ¼, ⅛, we muſt, afterwards, by theſe Diviſions, draw Parallels to A B and A C, and the Line A E, which muſt expreſs the compounded Motion that is ſought, ſhall neceſſarily paſs through all the Points where theſe Parallels interſect, and ſo we diſcover the Way that this Body, once put in Motion, ought to keep.</p>
                        <p>If we wou'd know exactly how long this Body hath begun to be moved, when it is arrived to ſuch a Point: The Parallels drawn from this Point upon A B or A C, will mark it, for the Diviſions of A B and A C mark the Time; ſo if we wou'd know the Point where this Body will be in ſuch a Time, the Parallels drawn from the Diviſions of the Lines A B and A C, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this Time, by their Interſection mark the Point which is ſought, A. For the Diſtance of the Place from whence it began to move, it will always be eaſily known by drawing a Line from this Point A: For the Length of this Line will be known, by the Proportion it has to A B or to A C, which are known. But for the Length of the Way that this Body will have run through before it arrives to this Point, will be difficult to be known, becauſe the Line of its Motion, A E, being a Curve, we cannot compare it to any of theſe right Lines.</p>
                        <p>But if we wou'd determine the infinite Points by which this Body muſt paſs, that is exactly, and by a continued Motion deſcribe the Line A E, we muſt make a Pair of Compaſſe, the Motion of whoſe legs ſhould be regulated according to the Conditions expreſſed in the Computation we have already made, which is often very difficult to invent, impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and unuſeful enough to diſcover the Relations that things have amongſt themſelves. Since common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107782:74"/>we have not need of all the Points whereof this Line is compoſed, but only of ſome of them which ſerve to guide the Imagination when it conſiders ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Examples will be ſufficient to ſhow, That we may expreſs by Lines, and ſo repreſent to our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the greateſt Part of our Idea's; and that Geomertry which ſhows us how to make all the Compariſons that are neceſſary in order to knowing the Proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Lines, is of a much more extenſive Uſe than is commonly thought. For in fine, Aſtronomy, Muſick, Mechanics, and in general all Sciences which treat of Objects that are capable of <hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſs,</hi> and which conſequently we may look upon as extended, that is, all exact Sciences have Relation to Geometry: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Speculative Truths conſiſting only in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of things, and in the Relation that is found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Relations, they may all relate to Lines. We may draw from hence many Geometrical Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and theſe Conſequences being made ſenſible by Lines which repreſent them, it is almoſt impoſſible to deceive our ſelves, and we may carry on Sciences very far with much Eaſe.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, the Means be which we diſcover very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and preciſely mark, in Muſick, an Eighth, a Fifth, a Fourth, is that Sounds may be expreſſed by Cords, exactly divided; and we know that a String which ſounds an Eighth is in double Proportion to another by which an Eighth is made; that the Fifth is in <hi>ſeſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alter</hi> Proportion, or as 3 to 2, and ſo of the reſt. For the Ear only, cannot judge of Sounds with that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs and Juſtneſs which is neceſſary to a Science. The moſt skilful Practitinoners, who have the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and fine Ear, have not been hitherto ſufficiently able to diſcover the Difference there is between certain Sounds; and they falſely perſwade themſelves there is none, becauſe they judge of thing only by the Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they have of them. Some cannot diſtinguiſh any Difference between an Octave and three Ditons; and ſome even think that the greater Tone is not different from the leſs; ſo that a <hi>Comma</hi> which conſtitutes the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107782:75"/>Difference is to them inſenſible, and much more a <hi>Schiſma,</hi> which is but half a <hi>Comma.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is only Reaſon therefore which manifeſtly ſhows that the Space of the Line which makes the Difference betwixt certain Sounds, being diviſible into many Parts, there may alſo be a great Number of different Sounds, which wou'd be uſeful in Muſick, that the Ear cannot diſcern; from whence it is plain that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arithmetick and Geometry, regular and exact Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, wou'd be unknown to us, and we cou'd not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh any thing in this Science, but by chance and Imagination; and ſo Muſick wou'd no longer be a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence founded upon indiſputable Demonſtrations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Airs that are compoſed by the Strength of the Imagination, are more fine and agreeable to the Senſes, than thoſe that are compoſed by Rules.</p>
                        <p>So in Mechanicks, the Gravity of ſome Weights, and the Diſtance of the Center of Gravity of theſe Weights from the Fulciment being capable of <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs,</hi> may be expreſſed by Lines, ſo that we may very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly make uſe of Geometry to diſcover and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate an infinite Number of new Inventions, that are very uſeful to Life, and alſo very agreeable to the Mind, becauſe of the Evidence which accompanies them.</p>
                        <p>If for inſtance, we have a Weight given of ſix Pound, that we wou'd put in <hi>Equilibrio</hi> with one of three Pound only; and that this Weight of ſix Pound be ſuſpended on the Beam of a Ballance, two Feet diſtant from the Fulciment, only knowing the general Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all Mechanicks: <hi>That the Weights to continue in Equilibrio, muſt be in Reciprocal Proportion to their Diſtance from the Fulciment:</hi> That is, one Weight muſt be to the other Weight as the Diſtance which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the laſt Weight from the Fulciment, is to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the firſt from the ſame Fulciment; it will be eaſily found by Geometry, what the Diſtance of the Weight of three Pound ought to be, ſo that both may be brought into <hi>Equilibrio;</hi> in finding a fourth ſtance between the firſt from the ſame Fulciment; it will be eaſily found by Geometry, what the Diſtance of the Weight of three Pound ought to be, ſo that both may be brought into <hi>Equilibrio;</hi> in finding a fourth proportional Line, according to the twelfth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the ſixth Book of <hi>Euclid,</hi> which will be of four
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107782:75"/>Foot. Thus only knowing the Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Mechanicks, we may clearly diſcover all the Truths that depend upon it, by applying Geometry to Mechanicks; that is, by expreſſing by Lines all things that are to be conſidered in Mechanicks.</p>
                        <p>Geometrical Lines and Figures then are moſt proper to repreſent to the Imagination the Relation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Magnitudes, or between things which differ as to <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs,</hi> as Spaces, Times, Weights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well becauſe they are very ſimple Objects, as becauſe they are imagined with great Facility. We may even ſay further to the Advantage of Geometry, that Lines can repreſent to the Imagination more things than the Mind can receive: Since Lines can expreſs the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of incommenſurable Magnitudes, that is, of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes whoſe Relations we cannot know, becauſe they have no common Meaſure by which can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them. But this Advantage is not very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in an Enquiry after Truth, ſince theſe ſenſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of incommenſurable Magnitudes diſcover nothing to the Mind.</p>
                        <p>Geometry is then very uſeful to render the Mind at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to ſuch things whoſe Relations we wou'd diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: But it muſt be confeſſed that it is ſometimes an Occaſion of Error, becauſe we ſo very much apply our ſelves to evident and agreeable Demonſtrations which this Science furniſheth us with, that we do not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conſider Nature. 'Tis chiefly for this Reaſon, that all Machines that have been invented, have not been perfected: That all Muſical Compoſitions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Proportions of Conſonancy's are the beſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are not the moſt agreeable; and that the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Computations in Aſtronomy do not always beſt foretel the Greatneſs and Duration of Eclipſes. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not abſtracted: Levers and Mechanical Wheels are not Mathematical Lines and Circles: The Taſte of Muſical Airs is not always the ſame in all Men, nor even in the ſame Men at different Times. They change according to the different Motions of the Spirits, ſo that there is nothing more uncertain. As for what reſpects Aſtronomy, there is no perfect Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107782:76"/>in the Courſe of the Planets: Moving in theſe great Spaces they are diſorderly hurried by the fluid Matter which encompaſſes them: So that the Errors we are ſubject to in Aſtronomy, Mechanicks, Muſick, and in all the Sciences to which we apply Geometry, Proceeds not from Geometry, which is an indiſputable Science, but from the falſe Application we make of it.</p>
                        <p>We ſuppoſe, for inſtance, that the Planets, by their Motions, deſcribe Circles and Elipſes perfectly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which though it is not true, yet 'tis neceſſary to reaſon from it, for the Error miſſes but very little of truth; but we ought always to remember, that the Principle upon which we reaſon is but a Suppoſition: So in Mechanicks we ſuppoſe that Wheels and Levers are perfectly hard, and like Mathematical Lines and Circles, without Gravity and Attrition, or rather we do not ſufficiently conſider their Gravity, Attrition, Matter, or the Relation that theſe things have amongſt themſelves, that Hardneſs or Magnitude increaſes Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; that Gravity increaſes Attrition, and Attrition diminiſhes the Machine. Thus, what is often accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in a ſmall Portion of Matter, is ſeldom ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in a greater.</p>
                        <p>It is no Wonder then if we deceive our ſelves, when we wou'd reaſon upon Principles that are not exactly known: Nor can we conclude Geometry to be unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe it delivers us not from all our Errors. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions eſtabliſhed, make us argue conſequently; rendring our ſelves attentive to what we conſider, make us know it evidently. We even by that means diſcover when our Suppoſitions are falſe; for being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways certain that our Reaſonings are true, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience agreeing not with them, we diſcover that our Principles are falſe. But without Geometry and Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick we can diſcover nothing exactly, if there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little Difficulty in it, although we have certain and indiſputable Principles.</p>
                        <p>Therefore we ought to look upon Geometry as a kind of univerſal Science, which inlarges the Mind, makes it attentive, and gives it
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107782:76"/>the Art of regulating the Imagination, and from whence may be drawn all the Helps that it can receive: For by the Aſſistance of Geometry the Mind regulates the Motion of the Imagination; and the Imagination thus regulated maintains the Preſence and Application of the Mind.</p>
                        <p>But that we may make a good uſe of Geometry, we muſt obſerve that all things which fall under the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, cannot be imagined with an equal Facility; for all Images do not equally fill the Capacity of the Mind. It is more difficult to imagine a ſolid than a plane, and a plane than a ſimple Line; for there is more Thought in the clear View of a ſolid, than in that of a Plane or Line. It is ſo likewiſe with different Lines, more Thought is requiſite, that is, a greater Capacity of Mind, to repreſent a Parabolick, Eliptical, or ſome other Line more compounded, than to repreſent the Circumference of a Circle; and more for the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of a Circle, than for a right Line; becauſe 'tis more difficult to imagine Lines which are deſcribed by very compounded Motions, and which have many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, than thoſe which are deſcribed by the moſt ſimple Motions, or which have fewer Relations. For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations cannot be clearly perceived without the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mind to many things, and ſo much the more Thought is required to perceive them, as they are in greater Number. There are ſome Figures ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded that the Mind has not Extenſion enought to imagine them diſtinctly; but there is alſo ſome others that the Mind very eaſily imagins.</p>
                        <p>Of the three kinds of right lined Angles; the acute, the right, and obtuſe; it is only the right that raiſes a very diſtinct and fixed Idea in the Mind. There is an infinite Number of acute Angles which differ amonſt themſelves; it is the ſame alſo with the obtuſe. So that when we imagine an acute or an obtuſe Angle, we imagine nothing exact or diſtinct; but when we imagine a right Angle we cannot deceive our ſelves; the Idea is very diſtinct, and even the Image that we form of it in the Brain is commonly exact enough.</p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:107782:77"/>
                        <p>It is true, we may alſo determine the general Idea of an acute Angle, by a particular Idea of an Angle of thirty Degrees; and the Idea of an Angle of thirty Degrees, is as exact as that of an Angle of Ninety, or of a right Angle. But the Image that we form of it in the Brain, would not be near ſo Juſt as that of a right Angle. We are not accuſtomed to repreſent this Image to our ſelves, and we can trace it only by thinking upon a Circle, or ſuch a determined Portion of a Circle divided into equal parts. But to imagine a right Angle, it is not neceſſary to think on this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Circle, the Idea only of a Perpendicular is ſufficient for the Imagination to trace the Image of this Angle; and we find no difficulty to repreſent Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars, becauſe we are accuſtomed to ſee all things ſtand upright.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore very eaſie to judge, that to have a ſimple, diſtinct and well-determined Object proper to be eaſily conceived, and conſequently to make the Mind attentive, and preſerve evidence in the Truths it enquires after, we muſt compare all Magnitudes, as we conſider them, to ſimple Surfaces determined by Lines and right Angles, as perfect Squares and other right-lined Figures, or elſe to ſimple right Lines; for theſe are the Figures whoſe Nature we know.</p>
                        <p>We do not pretend that all Subjects, whoſe Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we may enquire into, can be expreſſed by Lines and Geometrical Figures. There are many that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nay that ought not to be ſubjected to this Rule: For inſtance, The Knowledge we have of a God infinitely Powerful, infinitely Juſt, upon whom all things depend in all reſpects, who wills that all his Creatures ſhould execute his orders to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves capable of Happineſs. This Knowledge. I ſay, is the Principle of all Morality; and from hence may be drawn an infinite number of certain and indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſequences; and yet neither this Principle nor its Conſequences can be expreſſed by Geometrical Figures; neither is it poſſible to determine or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by Lines an infinite number of Phyſical Notions,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107782:77"/>which may nevertheleſs evidently diſcover ſeveral Truths to us. Yet is it certain that there are a great many things which may be examined and learned by this Geometrical Method; and that it is always ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to uſe it, becauſe it accuſtoms the Mind to Attention, by cauſing it to make a regular uſe of the Imagination; and that things which are learned by this way, appear more clearly demonſtrated, and are more eaſily remembred than others.</p>
                        <p>I might have attributed to the Senſes, the Aſſiſtance which is drawn from Geometry, but I thought that Geometry did rather belong to the Imagination than to the Senſes, although Lines are ſomething ſenſible: It would be unneceſſary here to give he Reaſons that I had for it. Since they would only ſerve to juſtifie the order that I have kept in what I have ſaid, which is not eſſential. I have neither ſpoke of Arithmetick nor Algebra, ſince the Numeral Figures, and Letters of the Alphabet, which are uſed in theſe Sciences, are not ſo uſeful to increaſe the Attention as the Capacity of the Mind, as ſhall be explained in the following Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the General Helps which may make the Mind more attentive, I know no other, except it be the will of being ſo; which I do not treat of, becauſe it is ſuppoſed that all thoſe who Study, are willing to give Attention to what they Study.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs there are many others which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to certain perſons, as ſome ſort of Drinks, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Meats, certain Places, and certain Diſpoſitions of Body; with ſome other helps, of which every one ought to be inſtructnd by his own Experience. The Condition of our Imagination ought to be obſerved after Eating; and we muſt conſider what things they are that maintain or diſſipate the Attention of the Mind. What more general might be ſaid, is, That the moderate uſe of ſuch Food as creates many Animal Spirits, is very fit to increaſe the Attention of th Mind, and Strength of the Imagination, in thoſe who have them Weak and Languiſhing.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Means to increaſe the Extenſion and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Mind. That Arithmetick and Algebra are abſolutely neceſſary to this end.</head>
                        <p>IT ought not immediately to be imagined that we can truly increaſe the Extenſion and Capacity of the Mind. The Soul of Man is, if we may ſo ſay, a determined Quantity or Portion of Thought, which hath limits that cannot be exceeded: The Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not become more Extenſive or Capacious than it is: It is not ſwelled nor enlarged after the ſame manner as we ſee Liquors and Metals are. In fine, It never Perceives more in one time than in another.</p>
                        <p>It is true this ſeems contrary to Experience; for often we think upon many Objects, and as oft but upon one only; and we often ſay likewiſe, that we think upon nothing at all. Yet if we conſider, that Thought is to the Soul what Extenſion is to the Body, we ſhall plainly diſcover, that as a Body cannot be truly more extended at one time than another, ſo, if we conceive aright, neither can the Soul think more at one time than another: Whether it perceives many Objects, or but one, or even in the time that we ſay we think on nothing at all.</p>
                        <p>But the reaſon why we imagine we think more at one time than another, is, becauſe we do not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſtinguiſh between confuſed and diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; without doubt there is more Thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or the Capacity of Thinking is more fitted, to perceive many things diſtinctly at once, than to perceive but one only: But there is not more Thought requiſite to perceive many things confuſedly, than to perceive one diſtinctly. So there is no more Thought in the Soul when it thinks of many things, than when it thinks of but one; ſince when it thinks of but one only, it always perceives it much more clearly, than when it applies it ſelf to many.</p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:107782:78"/>
                        <p>For it muſt be obſerved, that a pure ſimple Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſometimes includes as much Thought, or fills as much the Capacity that the Mind hath of Thinking, as a Judgment, nay even a compounded reaſoning: Since Experience teaches us, That a lively, clear and evident Perception but of one thing only, imploys and takes up the Mind as much as a compounded Reaſoning, or an obſcure and confuſed Perception of ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations between many things.</p>
                        <p>For even as there is as much or more Senſation in the ſenſible view of an Object that I hold near my Eyes and carefully examine, as in the proſpect of a whole Field, that I look upon negligently and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Attention: so that the clearneſs o the Senſation that I have of the Object which is near my Eyes, recompences the Extenſion of the confuſed Senſation I have of many things, that I ſee without Attention in a Field: Thus the Proſpect the Mind has of one Object only, is ſometimes ſo lively and diſtinct, that it includes as much or even more Thought, than a Proſpect of the Relations which are between many things.</p>
                        <p>It is true at certain times, it ſeems to us that we think of but one thing, and nevertheleſs we have ſome difficulty to comprehend it well; and at other times we comprehend both this thing and many others with great Facility. From thence we imagine that the Soul hath more Extenſion, or a greater Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Thinking at one time than another; but it is plain we deceive our ſelves. The Reaſon why at certain times we have ſome Difficulty to conceive the moſt eaſie things, is not becauſe the Thought of the Soul, or its Capacity of Thinking, is diminiſhed; but becauſe this Capacity is filled either by ſome lively Senſation of Pain or Pleaſure, or by a great number of weak and obſcure Senſations, which cauſe a kind of Vapor, and which for the moſt part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a confuſed Senſation of a great number of Things.</p>
                        <p>A piece of Wax is capable of a very diſtinct Figure, yet it cannot receive two, but then one will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107782:79"/>the other, for it cannot be entirely round and ſquare at the ſame time; indeed if it received a Million, none of them would be diſtinct. Now if this piece of Wax was capable of knowing its Figures, it could not know by what Figure it muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, if the number of them were too great. It is the ſame with our Soul, when a great number of Modifications fill its Capacity, it cannot perceive them diſtinctly, becauſe it ſees them not ſeparately; this makes it think it perceives nothing at all. It cannot ſay that it is ſenſible Pain, Pleaſure, Light, Sound, Taſte; it is none of all theſe, and yet it is all theſe that it perceives.</p>
                        <p>But although we ſhould ſuppoſe the Soul not to be ſubjected to the confuſed and irregular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Animal Spirits; or ſo diſingaged from the Body, that its Thoughts ſhould not depend upon whatſoever paſſed in it; it might then happen that we ſhould more eaſily comprehend certain things in one time than in another, and yet the Capacity of the Soul be neither diminiſhed nor increaſed.</p>
                        <p>The general Idea of Infinity is inſeparable from the Mind, and it wholly takes up its Capacity when it thinks not of ſome particular thing.</p>
                        <p>For when we ſay we think of nothing, it does not follow that we do not think of this general Idea, but ſimply that we do not think of any thing in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                        <p>Certainly if our Mind was not filled with this Idea, we could not think of all ſorts of things as we do; for indeed we cannot think of thoſe things that we have no knowledge of. And if this Idea was no more preſent to the Mind, when it ſeems to us that we think of nothing, than when we think of any thing in particular, we ſhould have as much Facility to think of what we would, when we vigorouſly apply our ſelves to any particular Truth, as when we apply our ſelves to nothing; which is contrary to Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. For inſtance, When we are attentive to any Propoſition in Geometry, we cannot ſo eaſily think of any thing elſe, as when we are diverted by no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107782:79"/>Thought: So we think more upon the General and Infinite Being, when we think leaſt on Particular and Finite Beings: Thus we think as much at one time as another.</p>
                        <p>We cannot therefore increaſe the Extenſion and Capacity of the Mind by ſwelling it up, if we may ſo ſay, and in giving it more Reality than it Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally has, but only by managing it artificially, which is perfectly done by Arithmetick and <hi>Algebra.</hi> For theſe Sciences afford means of abridging our Idea's ſo methodically, and conſidering them in ſuch an order, that although the Mind hath little Extenſion, it is able, by the help of theſe Sciences, to diſcover the moſt compounded Truths, which at firſt appear incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible. But we muſt take things in their firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to explain them with the utmoſt Clearneſs and Certainty.</p>
                        <p>Truth is nothing elſe but a real Relation of Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Inequality: Falſhood is only a <hi>Negation</hi> of Truth, or a Falſe and Imaginary Relation. Truth is that which Exiſts, Falſhood has no Being; or if you will, it is that which is not: We never deceive our ſelves when we ſee real Relations, ſince we are not deceived when we ſee the Truth: We always deceive our ſelves, when we judge that we ſee certain Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and theſe Relations are not: For when we ſee Falſhood, we ſee what is not, or rather we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. Whoſoever ſees the Relation of Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity between twice two and four, ſees a Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſees a relation of Equality, which is what he ſees it to be. So whoſoever ſees a relation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, between twice two and five, ſees a Truth, becauſe he ſees a relation of Inequality which truly Exiſts: But if any one judges he ſees a relation of Equality between twice two and five he deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he ſees, or rather thinks he ſees a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Equality which is not. Truths are only Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therefore, and the Knowledge of Truth is the Knowledge of theſe Relations. But Falſhood is not, and the Knowledge of Falſhood, or a Falſe Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is the Knowledge of what is not, if we may ſo
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107782:80"/>ſpeak; for as we cannot know what is not, only in relation to what is, we can diſcover Error only by comparing it with Truth.</p>
                        <p>We may diſtinguiſh as many different kinds of Falſhood, as of Truth: And as there are relations of three ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> of one Idea to another, of an Object to its Idea, or of an Idea to its Object; and laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one Object and another, ſo there are Truths and Falſities of three ſorts: There are ſome between Idea's, between Things and their Idea's, and between Things only. It is true that twice two is four; it is falſe that twice two are five: Here is a Truth and a Falſity between Idea's. It is true that there is a Sun; it is falſe that there is two: Here is a Truth and a Falſhood between Things and their Idea's. It is true alſo that the Earth is greater than the Moon; and it is falſe that the Sun is leſs than the Earth: Here is a Truth and a Falſhood which is only between Things.</p>
                        <p>Of theſe three ſorts of Truths, thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Idea's are Eternal and Immutable; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Immutability, they are alſo the Rules and Meaſures of all other; for all Rules and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ought to be unchangeable. And therefore in <hi>Arithmetick, Algebra,</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> we only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe ſorts of Truths, becauſe theſe general Sciences regulate and include all particular Sciences. All Relations, or Truths which are between created things, or between Idea's and things created, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Changes that all Creatures are capable of. The Truths only, which are between our Idea's and the Supream Being are immutable; as are thoſe that are between Idea's only; becauſe God is no more ſubject to Change, than the Idea's which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes.</p>
                        <p>The Truths alſo that are between Idea's, are only thoſe that we endeavour to diſcover by the Exerciſe of the Mind; for we generally make uſe of our Senſes to diſcover others; we prove the Exiſtence of things by our Eyes and Hands, and by them diſcover the Relations of Equality or Inequality that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107782:80"/>them. 'Tis the Relations between Idea's only, that the Mind can Diſcover of it ſelf without the uſe of the Senſes. But ther are not only Relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Idea's, but alſo between the Relations that are between Idea's, between the Relations of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Idea's; and in fine, between the aggregate of many Relations, and between the Relations of theſe Aggregates of Relations, and ſo on <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> that is, There are compounded Truths <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A ſimple Truth of Geometry, or the Relation of one entire Idea to another, as the Relation of four to two, or to twice two, is called a <hi>Geometrick</hi> or ſimple <hi>Ratio;</hi> for the Exceſs or Defect of an Idea, or to uſe the common Terms, The Exceſs or Defect of a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, is not properly a Ratio, nor are equal Exceſſes or Defects equal Ratio's: When Idea's or Magnitudes are equal, 'tis a Ratio of Equality; when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, the Ratio is of Inequality.</p>
                        <p>The Relation that is between the Relation of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes, that is, between their Ratio's, is called a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Ratio,</hi> becauſe it is a compounded Relation: As the Relation that is between the Relation of 6 to 4, and of 3 to 2 is a compounded Ratio; and when the compounded Ratio's are equal, this compounded Ratio is called <hi>Proportion</hi> or <hi>double Ratio:</hi> The Relation that is between the Relations of 8 to 4, and of 6 to 3, are a Proportion, becauſe theſe Relations are equal.</p>
                        <p>Now it muſt be obſerved, that all Relations, or Ratio's, whether Simple or Compounded, are true Magnitudes; and that the Term Magnitude is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and neceſſarily includes ſome Relation; for there is nothing great of it ſelf, and without Relation to any thing elſe, except <hi>Infinity</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> All whole Numbers are as really Relations as fracted Numbers, or Numbers compared to, or divided by others: Although we cannot reflect thereon, becauſe theſe whole Numbers may be expreſſed by one Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick Deſignation: For inſtance, 4/1 or 8/2 is as real a Relation, as ¼ or 2/8: The Unity to which 4 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates is not expreſſed, but it is underſtood, for 4 is a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107782:81"/>Relation as well as 4/1 or 8/2, ſince 4 is equal to 4/1 or to 8/2. All Magnitudes then being a Relation, or all Relations a Magnitude, it is evident that all Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be expreſſed by Figures, and repreſented to the Imagination by Signs.</p>
                        <p>Thus all Truths being only Relations, to diſcover exactly all Truths as well Simple as Compound, we ſhould know all Relations as well Simple as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound: There are two ſorts of them, as we have already ſaid, Relations of Equality and Inequality: It is plain that all Relations of Equality are alike, and as ſoon as we know one thing is equal to another known thing, we know exactly the Relation of it. But it is not the ſame with thoſe of Inequality; we know that a Tower is commonly higher than ſix feet, and lower than a thouſand; and yet we know not its juſt Magnitude, nor the Relation it has to ſix Feet.</p>
                        <p>To compare things amongſt themſelves, or rather exactly to meaſure the Relations of Inequality, we muſt have an exact meaſure; we muſt have a ſimple and infinitely Intelligible Idea, which may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to all forts of Subjects. This Meaſure is Unity; by that it is that we exactly meaſure all things, and without it is impoſſible to know any thing exactly. But all Numbers being compounded of Unity, it is ſelf-evident, that without the Idea's of Numbers, and manner of comparing and meaſuring theſe Idea's, that is, without Arithmetick, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to advance to the Knowledge of compounded Truths.</p>
                        <p>Idea's, or the Relations between Idea's, in a word, Magnitudes, when they are greater or leſs than other Magnitudes, cannot be made equal except by <hi>More</hi> or <hi>Leſs,</hi> which is compounded of Unity; ſo many times repeated as is neceſſary: So it is only by Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Subſtraction of Unity, and the parts of Unity (when we conceive it divided) that we exactly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all Magnitudes, and diſcover all Truths. Now of all the Sciences <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Algebra</hi> are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the only ones, which teach us to make theſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107782:81"/>Operations artificially, inſtructively, and admirably, to manage the Capacity of the Mind; ſince they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it with all the Perfection and Extenſion it is capable of; becauſe 'tis by them only that we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all knowable Truths with the greateſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs.</p>
                        <p>Common Geometry perfects the Imagination more than it does the Mind; and the Truths which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by this Science, are not always ſo evident as Geometers imagine. For inſtance, They think they have expreſſed the value of certain Magnitudes, when they have proved them equal in value to certain Lines, as the Hypothenuſa's in right Angle Triangles whoſe Legs are known; or of others which are determined by ſome of the Conick Sections. But it is plain they deceive themſelves, for theſe Hypothenuſa's for inſtance are themſelves unknown: We more exactly know the √ 8 or √ 20, than a Line that we imagine, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe upon Paper for the Hypothenuſe of a right-angled Triangle, whoſe ſides are two, whereof one is two and the other four: We know at leaſt that √ 8 ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches very near to 3, and that √ 20 is about 4 ½; and by certain Rules we can approach Infinitely nearer and nearer to their true Magnitude; and if we cannot arrive to it, 'tis only becauſe the Mind cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Infinity: But we have only a very confuſed Idea of the Magnitude of Hypothenuſa's, and we are even obliged to have recourſe to √ 8 or √ 20 to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them. Thus Geometrick Conſtructions, which ſerve to expreſs the values of unknown quantities, are not ſo uſeful in regulating the Mind, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Relations or Truths which we enquire after, as to regulate the Imagination. But as we are much more pleaſed to make uſe of our Imagination than our Mind, Studious Perſons have commonly more Eſteem for Geometry, than for Arithmetick and Algebra.</p>
                        <p>To Make it perfectly apprehended, that Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Algebra together are the true Logick, which ſerves to diſcover things as they are, and to give the Mind all the Extenſion it is capable of: It ill be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107782:82"/>ſufficient to make ſome Reflections upon the Rules of theſe Sciences.</p>
                        <p>We have a little before ſaid, that all Truths are only Relations; that the moſt ſimple and beſt known, is that of Equality: That this is the begining from whence others muſt be meaſured, to have an exact Idea of Inequality; that the Meaſure we are obliged to make uſe of is Unity; that we muſt add of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract it as many times as is neceſſary, to meaſure the Exceſs or Defect of the Inequality of theſe Magnitudes.</p>
                        <p>From thence it is plain that all Operations, which may be of uſe to diſcover the Relations of Equality, are only Additions or Subſtractions: Additions of Magnitudes to Equal Magnitudes, Additions of Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to equal Relations, or to place Magnitudes in Proportion: In ſhort, Addition of relations to equal relations, or to put Magnitudes in compounded Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
                        <p>To equal 2 to 4, it is only requiſite to add 2 to 2, or cut off 2 from 4; or to add unity to 2 and ſubſtract it from 4.</p>
                        <p>To make the relation of 8 to 2, equal to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 6 to 3, we muſt not add 3 to 2, nor ſubſtract 3 from 8; ſo that the exceſs of one number to the other may be equal to 3, which is the exceſs of 6 above 3; that would be only an Addition and equalling ſimple Magnitudes: We muſt firſt ſee what is the Magnitude of the Ratio of 8 to 2, or which is all one 8/2; and we find by dividing 8 by 2, that the Quote of this Ratio is 4; or that 8/2 is equal to 4; we muſt alſo examine what the Magnitude of the Relation of 6 to 3 is, and fin that 'tis equal to 2. Thus we diſcover that theſe twe Ratio's 8/2 is equal to 4, and 6/3 equal to 2, differ only by 2; ſo that to equal them, we may either add 6/3 (equal to 2) to 6/3 which makes 12/3 which is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equal to 8/2, or elſe ſubſtract 4/2 equal to 2 from 8/2, and there remains 4/2, which will be a Ratio equal to 6/3; or in fine, add unity to 6/3, and ſubſtract it from 8/2, and we ſhall have 9/3 and 6/2 which are equal Ratio's, for 9 is to 3 as 6 to 2.</p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:107782:82"/>
                        <p>Laſtly, To find the Magnitude of the Inequality between Relations which reſult the one from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Ratio, or from the relation of the relation of 12 to 3, and of 3 to 1; and the other of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Ratio, or of the relation of the relation of 8 to 2, and of 2 to 1, the ſame method muſt be taken. Firſt, The Magnitude of the Ratio of 12 to 3 is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by 4, or 4 is the Quote of the Ratio of 12 to 3, and 3 is the Quote of that of 3 to 1; and the Quote of the Ratio of the Quotes of 4 and 3 is 4/3. Secondly, The Quote of 8 to 2 is 4, and that of 2 to 1 is 2; and the Quote of the Quotes 4 and 2 is 2. In fine, The Inequality between the relations which reſult from the relations of the relations, is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 4/2 and 2, <hi>viz.</hi> 2/3. Therefore 2/3 added to the relation of the Ratio's of 12 to 3, and 3 to 1, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the relation of the other Ratio's 8 to 2, and 2 to 1, equals theſe relations of relations, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a compounded Proportion. Thus we may make uſe of Addition and Subſtraction, to equal both Magnitudes and their relations as well Compound as Simple, and ſo have an exact Idea of the Magnitude of their Inequality.</p>
                        <p>It is true we make uſe of <hi>Multiplications</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> as well ſimple as compounded, but they are only compounded Additions and Subſtractions. Multiply 4 by 3, it makes as many Additions of 4 as 3, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Additions of unity, or finds a number which has the ſame relation to 4, as the 3 has to unity: And to divide 12 by 4, is to ſubſtract 4 from 12 as many times as we can; that is, to find a relation to unity equal to that of 12 to 4; for 3 which will be the Quote of it, has the ſame relation to unity as 12 to 4. <hi>The Extractions of ſquare and cubick Roots,</hi> &amp;c. are only Diviſions, whereby we ſeek one, two, or three <hi>Mean Proportionals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is evident that the Mind of Man is ſo narrow, his Memory ſo treacherous, and his Imagination ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, that without the uſe of Figures and Writing, and the artificial way we have of uſing them in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, it would be impoſſible to make ſuch Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107782:83"/>as are neceſſary to diſcover the Inequality of Magnitudes and their relations: If we had many numbers to add or to ſubſtract, or which is the ſame thing, when theſe Numbers are great, and that we could only add them by parts, we ſhould always for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſome of them. There being no Imagination ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive enough to add Fractions together which conſiſt of many places, as <gap reason="math">
                              <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or to ſubſtract the one from the other.</p>
                        <p>Multiplications, Diviſions and Extractions of Roots in whole numbers are infinitely more perplexing, than pure Additions or Subſtractions: Without the help of Arithmetick, the Mind is too confin'd and too weak to make them; and it is ſo plain, that it would be unneceſſary for me to ſtop here to prove it.</p>
                        <p>Yet <hi>Algebra</hi> is a thing quite different from Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick: It much leſs divides the Capacity of the Mind; it abridges our Idea's after the moſt ſimple and eaſie Method that can be conceived: What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires quires much time to be performed in Arithmetick, is done by Algebra in a moment, without perplexing the Mind by changing of Figures, or long Operations. In ſhort, There are many things, that may and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known, which yet we cannot have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act knowledge of by Arithmetick only: But I believe there is nothing uſeful, and that Men can know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, but it may be diſcovered by Arithmetick and <hi>Algebra</hi> together. So that theſe two Sciences are the Foundation of all others, and give us the true way of acquiring all Sciences exactly; becauſe by their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we may better manage the Capacity of the Mind.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Rules that muſt be obſerved in the Enquiry after Truth.</head>
                        <p>AFter having explained the Method that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to render the Mind more attentive and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious, which is the only Way we have to make it more perfect, that is, more clear and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: It is time to proceed to the Rules that 'tis abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to obſerve, in the Reſolution of all Queſtions. This I ſhall ſpeak pretty fully to, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to explain it by many Inſtances, that its Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity may the better appear, and how the Mind ought to be accuſtomed to put it in uſe; becauſe it is not ſo difficult or neceſſary to know, as to practiſe well.</p>
                        <p>Something very extraordinary and ſurprizing muſt not be expected here, but on the contrary, to have theſe Rules good, they muſt be ſimple, natural, few in Number, very intelligible, and dependant one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another. In a Word, they ought only to conduct our Minds, and regulate our Attention without divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it. For Experience ſufficiently ſhows us, that the Logick of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of no great uſe, becauſe it imploys the Mind too much, and diverts it from the Attention it ought to give to thoſe Subjects it examines. Let thoſe then, who only love Myſteries, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Inventions, for ſome time quit this Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107782:84"/>Humour: And give all the Attention they are capable of, that they may examine whether the Rules that we lay down, are ſufficient always to preſerve Evidence in the Perceptions of the Mind, and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the moſt hidden Truths. If they do not unjuſtly prejudice themſelves againſt the Simplicity and Eaſineſs of them, I believe they will acknowledge, from the Uſe we ſhall hereafter make of them, that the moſt clear and ſimple Principles are the moſt fruitful, and that extraordinary and difficult things are not always ſo uſeful as our vain Curioſity would dictate to us.</p>
                        <p>The chief of theſe Rules is, <hi>That we muſt always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Evidence in our Reaſonings, to be able to diſcover the Truth without deceiving our ſelves.</hi> On this Princip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e depends this general Rule which regards the Subject of our Studies, <hi>viz. That we ought only to reaſon upon ſuch things as we have a clear Idea of.</hi> And by a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſequence, <hi>That we muſt always begin with the moſt ſimple and eaſie things, and continue ſome Time upon them, before we undertake to enquire into the more compounded and difficult ones.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Rules which reſpect the manner of reſolving Queſtions, depend likewiſe upon this firſt Principle; and the firſt of theſe Rules is, <hi>That we muſt have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conception of the Condition of the Queſtion that is propoſed to be reſolved,</hi> and have Idea's of theſe Terms clear enough to be able to compare them, and ſo to diſcover the Relations which we enquire after.</p>
                        <p>But when we cannot diſcover the Relations that things have amongſt themſelves, by immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them: The ſecond Rule is, <hi>One or many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Idea's muſt be found by the Effort of the Mind, which may ſerve as a common Meaſure; whereby to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Relations that are between them.</hi> It muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably obſerved, that theſe Idea's are ſo much the more clear and diſtinct, as the Relations we endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, are more accurate and in greater Number.</p>
                        <p>But when Queſtions are difficult, and of long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, the third Rule is, <hi>That we muſt carefully ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Sbject that we would conſider, all things that are not neceſſary to be examined to diſcover the Truth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107782:84"/>we ſeek:</hi> For we muſt not fruitleſly divide the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Mind: All its Power ought to be imployed in ſuch things only as can illuminate it. Things that may be thus ſeparated, are all thoſe that do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Queſtion, and which being taken away, the Queſtion remains intire.</p>
                        <p>The Queſtion being thus reduced to its leaſt Terms, the fourth Rule is; <hi>To divide the Subject of our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Parts, and conſider them one after another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Natural Order, beginning with the moſt ſimple,</hi> viz. <hi>thoſe that include the feweſt Relations, and never to paſs to the moſt compounded, before we have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly diſcovered the moſt ſimple, and made them familiar to us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When theſe things are become eaſie to us, by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; the fifth Rule is, <hi>To abridge our Idea's, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diſpoſe them in our Imagination, or write them upon Paper, that by that means they may no longer fill the Capacity of the Mind.</hi> Although this Rule is always uſeful, it is not abſolutely neceſſary, except in the moſt difficult Queſtions, which require a great Capacity of Mind, becauſe we inlarge the Mind only by abridging our Idea's. The Uſe of this Rule, and of thoſe which follow, cannot be diſcovered by any other Method than Algebra</p>
                        <p>The Idea's of all things which are abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be conſidered, being clear, familiar, ſhort, and put in order by the Imagination, or expreſſed upon Paper: The ſixth Rule is, <hi>They must all be compared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Combination, Alternately one with the other, either by a ſimple View of the Mind, or by the Motion of the Imagination, accompanied with this Proſpect of the Mind, or elſe by the Calculation of the Pen joyned to the Attention of the Mind and Imagination.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If of all the Relations which reſult from all theſe Compariſons, there ſhou'd not be found that which we ſeek: <hi>We muſt, anew, ſeparate from all theſe Relations, thoſe that are not uſeful in the Reſolving the Queſtion, and make the reſt eaſie, ſhort, and diſpoſe in the Imagination, or expreſs them upon Paper, Compare them together accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of Combinations, and examine whether
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107782:85"/>the compounded Relation that we ſeek, is any one of all thoſe compounded Relations which reſult from theſe new Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If none of theſe Relations which we have diſcovered include the Reſolution of the Queſtion: <hi>Then all theſe Relations muſt be thrown by as uſeleſs, and we muſt make others familiar,</hi> &amp;c. And in continuing after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we ſhall diſcover the true Relation that we ſeek how compounded ſoever it be; provided we can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently extend the Capacity of the Mind, by abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Idea's, and through all theſe Operations bear in Mind the Term we look for, 'tis a continual View of the Queſtion that muſt regulate all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the Mind, ſince 'tis neceſſary to know what we enquire after.</p>
                        <p>Above all, we muſt take care that we do not reſt ſatisfied with any falſe Appearance or Probability, but ſo often begin the Compariſons we make uſe of to diſcover the Truth till we cannot refrain our aſſent to it, without perceiving the ſecret Reproaches of the Maſter, who anſwers to our Requeſt. I mean our Endeavours, the Application of our Mind, and our Deſires; and then this Truth may ſerve us for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Principle to advance us in the Sciences.</p>
                        <p>All theſe Rules that we have given, are not general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary in all Sorts of Queſtions; for when Queſtions are very eaſie, the firſt Rule is ſufficient; and in many we need only the firſt and ſecond. In a Word, ſince we muſt make uſe of theſe Rules, until we have diſcovered the Truth that we ſeek, it is neceſſary to practiſe them ſo much the more as the Queſtions are more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Rules are not very numerous. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend all upon one another. They are natural, and may be rendred ſo familiar, that it will not be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to think much upon them when we have Occaſion to uſe them. In ſhort, they can ſo regulate the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mind as not to divided it, which is a great Part of what we deſire. But they appear, ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of themſelves that to recommend them, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſhow that Philoſophers are fallen into a great
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107782:85"/>many Errors and Extravagances, becauſe they have not ſo much as obſerved the two firſt which are the eaſieſt and cheifeſt; and that 'tis alſo by the Uſe that Mr. <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has made of them, that he has diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many great and beneficial Truths in his Works.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the general Rule which concerns the Subject of our Studies. That the Philoſophers have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, which has cauſed many Errors in Phyſicks.</head>
                        <p>THE firſt of theſe Rules, and that which concers the Subject of our Studies, teaches us that we ought only to reaſon upon clear Idea's; from whence this Conſequence may be drawn, that to preſerve a good Order in our Studies, we muſt begin with things that are moſt ſimple, and eaſie to be apprehended, and continue a great while upon them before we undertake the Diſquiſition of the moſt compound and difficult.</p>
                        <p>Every one will agree about the Neceſſity of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule, for 'tis plain enough, that to reaſon upon obſcure Idea's, and uncertain Principles, is to walk in the Dark; but it may be wondered at, if I ſaid 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved but very ſeldom, and that moſt of the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are ſtill the Subject of the Pride of ſome falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned Men, are only grounded upon either too confuſed or too general Idea's, to be uſeful in the Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Truth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who juſtly deſerves the Title of the Prince of theſe Philoſophers, which I ſpeak of, becauſe he is the Father of that Philoſophy which they cultivate with ſo much Care, ſeldom reaſons but upon confuſed Idea's which are received by the Senſes, and upon ſome other general and indeterminate Idea's, which repreſent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is particular to the Mind; for the Terms
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107782:86"/>common to this Philoſopher, can only ſerve confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expreſs to the Senſes and Imagination, the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Senſations we have of ſenſible things, or to make Men ſpeak after ſo general and indeterminate a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they expreſs nothing diſtinctly. Almoſt all his Works, but eſpecially his eight Books of <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> of which there are as different Commentators, as there are Profeſſors in Philoſophy, are nothing but a mere Logick, there are long Diſcourſes in it, without any thing at the Bottom: 'Tis not that he is prolix, but becauſe he has the Secret of being conciſe, and of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording nothing but Words: He does not make ſuch a frequent Uſe of his general Terms in his other Works, but thoſe he uſes only ſerve to ſtir up the confuſed Idea's of the Senſes; 'Tis by thoſe Idea's that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, in his Problems and elſewhere, in two Words, to reſolve an infinite Number of Queſtions, of which a Demonſtration may be given, that 'tis impoſſible to reſolve them.</p>
                        <p>But that my Meaning may the better be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, what I have proved elſewhere muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, <hi>viz,</hi> That all Terms which only ſtir up ſenſible Idea's are equivocal, but what is to be conſidered is, they are equivocal through Error and Ignorance; and conſequently cauſe an infinite Number of Errors.</p>
                        <p>The Word <hi>Ram</hi> is equivocal; it ſignifies both an Animal and a Conſtellation, in which the Sun enters at the Spring; but it is rare that we are deceived by it. For he muſt be a mighty Aſtrologer who ſhou'd imagine any Relation between theſe two things: And believe, for inſtance, that we are apt to vomit at that Time, if we take Medicines, becauſe the Ram chews the Cud. But for the Terms of ſenſible Idea's, there is hardly any body who diſcovers that they are equivocal. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the ancient Philoſophers, have not ſo much as thought of it, as will eaſily be granted, if we read any thing of their Works, and diſtinctly know the Cauſe why theſe Terms are equivocal. For there is nothing more evident, than that the Philoſophers have received the contrary to what ought to be believed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject.</p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:107782:86"/>
                        <p>For inſtance, when they ſay Fire is hot, Graſs green, Sugar ſweet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they think with Children and the Vulgar, that the Fire contains what they feel when they Warm themſelves; that Herbs have the ſame Colours upon them, as they believe they ſee; and that Sugar includes the Sweetneſs in it that we taſte in eating; and ſo of all things which we ſee or feel. It is impoſſible to doubt of this if we read their Writings: They ſpeak of ſenſible Qualities as of Senſations: They take Heat for Motion, and thus becauſe of the Equivocation of Terms, they confound the Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Bodies with the Modifications of Spirits.</p>
                        <p>'Tis only ſince <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> that theſe confuſed and indetermined Queſtions, whether Fire is hot, Herbs green, Sugar ſweet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been anſwered by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the Equivocations of ſenſible Terms which expreſs them. If by Heat, Colour, Taſte, you mean ſuch or ſuch a Motion of inſenſible Parts; Fire is hot, Herbs green, Sugar ſweet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if by Heat and the other Qualities, you mean, what I feel near the Fire, what I ſee when I look upon Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fire is not hot, nor Herbs green, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Heat that we feel, and Colours which we ſee, are only in the Soul, as I have proved in the firſt Part of this Book. Now, as Men think what they feel, is the ſame thing as what is really in the Object: They think they have a Right to judge of the Qualities of Objects, by the Senſations they have of them. So they ſpeak not two Words without ſaying ſomething falſe, nor ever ſpeak any thing upon this matter which is not obſcure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; as many following Reaſons will evince.</p>
                        <p>The firſt, becauſe all Men have not the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, nor one Man at different Times, or when he feels the ſame Objects by different Parts of his Body. What ſeems ſweet to this Man, is bitter to another; what is cold to this, the ſame is hot to another; what ſeems hot to one that is cold, ſeems cold to the ſame Perſon when he has warmed himſelf, or if he feels it in different Parts of his Body. If Water ſeems hot to one Hand, it often ſeems cold to the other, or to ſome Part near the Heat, if waſhed therewith. Salt ſeems
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107782:87"/>ſavoury to the Tongue, and ſharp to a Wound, Sugar ſeems ſweet to the Mouth, and Aloes extreamly bitter, but nothing is either ſweet or bitter to the reſt of the of the Senſes. So that when we ſay ſuch a thing is cold, ſweet, bitter, it determines nothing certainly.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond, becauſe different Objects may produce the ſame Senſation. Plaiſter, Bread, Snow, Sugar, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> produce the ſame Senſation of Colour: Yet their Whiteneſs is different, if we judge otherwiſe of them than by the Senſes. So when we ſay Flower is white, we ſay nothing diſtinctly.</p>
                        <p>The third, becauſe the Qualities of Bodies, which cauſe in us Senſations perfectly different, are almoſt the ſame; and on the contrary, thoſe of which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame Senſations, are often very different. There is ſcarcely any Difference in the Qualities of Sweetneſs and Bitterneſs that is in Objects, and yet the Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them are eſſentially different. The Motions which cauſe Pain or Titilation, differ only as to the more or leſs; and yet the Senſations of Titilation and Pain are eſſentially different. On the contrary, the Sharpneſs of Fruit differs not ſo much from Bitterneſs as Sweetneſs does, and yet this Quality is the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from Bitterneſs that can be. Since it is requiſite that a Fruit which is ſharp, becauſe it is too green, muſt receive a great Number of Changes before it grows bitter for being too much ripe or rotten. When Fruits are too ripe, they ſeem ſweet, and when they are a little too ripe they ſeem Bitter: Bitterneſs and Sweetneſs in Fruits differ then only as to the more or leſs; and that is the reaſon that ſome Perſons think them ſweet, when others think them bitter. For ſome there are who think Aloes as ſweet as Honey. It is the ſame with all Senſible Idea's. The Terms of ſweet, bitter, ſalt, ſharp, ſower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of red, green, yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of ſuch and ſuch Smells, Taſts, Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are therefore all equivocal, and ſtir up no clear and diſtinct Idea in the Mind: Yet School Philoſophers, and the vulgar, judge of all the Senſible Qualities of bodies, only by the Senſations they receive from them.</p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:107782:87"/>
                        <p>Theſe Philoſophers, not only judge of Senſible Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, by the Senſations they receive of them; but of things by a Conſequence of the Judgments they have made concerning Senſible Qualities. For what Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have eſſentially different from certain Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they believe is owing to a Generation of new Forms which produce theſe Imaginary Differences of Qualities, Corn appears yellow, hard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Flower white, ſoft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from thence they conclude from the Relation of their Eyes and Hands, that theſe are Bodies eſſentially different, not conſidering of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whereby Corn is changed into Flower; yet Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is only Corn broken and ground; as Fire is only Wood divided and agitated; and Aſhes, the groſſeſt Part of the Wood, ſeparated without Agitation; and Glaſs only Aſhes whereof each Part is poliſhed, and made a little round by the Attrition cauſed by Fire; and ſo of other Tranſmutations of Bodies.</p>
                        <p>It is then evident, that Senſible Terms and Idea's are wholly uſeleſs for a juſt propoſing, and clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of Queſtions, or the Diſcovery of Truth. Yet is there no Queſtion, however perplexed by the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Terms of the Senſes, but <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of the Philoſophers, pretend in their Books, to reſolve it without theſe Diſtinctions that we have given; not conſidering they are Equivocal through Ignorance and Error.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, if we demand of thoſe who have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their whole Lives in reading the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers or Phyſicians, and who have intirely eſpouſed their Sentiments; whether Water is moiſt, Fire dry, Wine hot, the Blood of Fiſhes cold, if Water is more crude than Wine, Gold more perfect than Quickſilver, whether Plants and Beaſts have Souls, and a thouſand other undetermined Queſtions? They will eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, without conſulting any thing but the Impreſſion theſe Objects have made upon their Senſes, or what their Memories have retained of their reading. They do not perceive that theſe Terms are equivocal. They think it ſtrange that they muſt define them, and are impatient if we endeavour to diſcover to them, that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107782:88"/>they go a little too faſt, and that their Senſes are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. They'll make Diſtinctions enough to confound the moſt evident things, and in theſe Queſtions where 'tis neceſſary to remove the Equivocation, they ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to diſtinguiſh.</p>
                        <p>If we conſider that the greateſt Part of the Queſtions of Philoſophers and Phyſicians include ſome equivocal Terms like thoſe we have ſpoken of, we cannot doubt but that theſe learned Men, who have not been able to define them, have delivered nothing Solid in all the great Volumes they have compoſed; and what I have ſaid may ſuffice to overthrow almoſt all the Opinions of the Ancients. But for <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> he perfectly knew how to diſtinguiſh theſe things. He reſolved no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by Senſible Idea's; and if we take the Pains to read him, we ſhall ſee he explained every thing after a more clear and evident Manner, and almoſt always demonſtrated them only by the diſtinct Idea's of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, Figure, and Motion.</p>
                        <p>The other kind of equivocal Terms which Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers make uſe of, comprehend all theſe general Terms of Logick, by which it is eaſie to explain things without having any Knowledge of them. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has made the moſt uſe of them, all his Books are full of them, and ſome are a mere Logick. He propoſes and reſolves all things by theſe Specious Words, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Species, Power, Nature, Form, Faculty, Quality, Cauſa per ſe, Cauſa per accidens:</hi> His Followers have had no ſmall Trouble to apprehend the meaning of theſe Words which ſignifie nothing at all, nor are they more learned than before, when they have heard ſay that Fire diſſolves Metals, becauſe it has a Faculty of diſſolving them; and that a Man digeſts not becauſe he has a weak Stomach, or that his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Concocting</hi> does not perform its Functions well.</p>
                        <p>It is true, thoſe who have made uſe of theſe Terms, and general Idea's, to explain all things by, do not commonly fall into ſo great a Number of Errors, as thoſe who only make uſe of them to ſtir up the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ideas of the Senſes. The Philoſophers of the Schools are, not ſo ſubject to Error as certain] Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107782:88"/>deciſive Phyſicians, who form Syſtems upon ſome Experiments, which they know not the reaſon of; becauſe they ſpeak ſo generally that they run no great Hazzard.</p>
                        <p>The Fire warms, dries, hardens, and ſoftens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has ſuch Faculties as produce theſe Effects: <hi>Senna</hi> purges by its Purgative Quality, Bread nouriſhes by its Nutritive Quality: Theſe Proportions are not ſubject to Error, for a Quality is that which denotes a thing by ſuch a Name; and we cannot deny it to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for indeed this Definition is indiſputable. Such, or the like manner of ſpeaking are not falſe, but only in Effect they ſignifie nothing. Theſe indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Idea's ingage us not in Error, but they are who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeleſs in the Diſcovery of Truth.</p>
                        <p>For although we know there is a ſubſtantial Form in Fire, accompanied with a thouſand Faculties, like to thoſe of heating, dilating, melting Gold, Silver, and all Metals; of clearing, burning, and baking: If this Difficulty be propoſed to me to be reſolved, <hi>viz.</hi> whether Fire can harden Dirt and ſoften Wax? The Idea's of Subſtantial Form, and of thoſe Faculties that produce Heat, Ratification, Fluidity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be of no uſe to me in reſolving the Queſtion; for there being no Connexion betwen the Idea's, of the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Dirt, and Softneſs of Wax, and thoſe of the Subſtantial Form of Fire, and the Qualities of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Rarification, Fluidity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is the ſame with all general Idea's, ſo they are wholly uſeleſs for the Ends deſigned.</p>
                        <p>But if we know that Fire is nothing elſe but the Parts of Wood put into continal Motion, and that 'tis only by this Agitation, that it excites the Senſation of Heat in us: If we knew at the ſame Time that the Softneſs of Dirt conſiſts only in a Mixture of Earth and Water, as theſe Idea's are not confuſed and general, but diſtinct and particular: It would not be difficult to ſee that the Heat of Fire muſt harden Dirt, becauſe one Body can move another, being it ſelf in Motion. We likewiſe eaſily diſcover, that ſince Heat, which is felt near the Fire, is cauſed by the Motion of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107782:89"/>Parts of the Wood, which, ſtrike againſt the Hands, if we expoſe Dirt to the Heat of the Fire, the Watery Parts, which are joyned to the Earth, being more loſe, and conſequently, ſooner agitated by the Shock of the little Bodies which go out from the Fire, than the groſs Particles of the Earth; they muſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and leave it dry and hard. It would alſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apppear, that Fire cannot harden Wax, if we knew that the Particles which compoſe it, are branched and very near of the ſame Bigneſs. Thus particular Idea's are very uſeful in an Enquiry after Truth: And indeterminate. Idea's are hot only uſeleſs, but on the contrary, inſenſibly lead us into Error.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Philoſophers content not themſelves with mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of general Terms, and indetermined Idea's that anſwer nothing: But they will have thoſe Terms ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie certain particular Beings. They pretend that there is ſome Subſtance diſtinct from Matter, which is the Form of Matter, and an infinite Company of little Beings really diſtinct from Matter and Form; of which they ſuppoſe as many of them as they have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Senſations of Bodies, and they think theſe Bodies produce different Effects.</p>
                        <p>Yet it is plain to any Man that is capable of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all theſe little Beings, diſtinct from Fire; for inſtance, and which we ſuppoſe to be contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the Production of Heat, Light, Hardneſs, Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idity, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> are only Fictions of the Imagination, which are contrary to Reaſon: For Reaſon hath no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Idea which repreſents theſe little Beings. If we ask the Philoſophers, what Sort of Entity that Faculty in the Fire is which gives Light, they will only anſwer that 'tis a Being which is the Cauſe why Fire is capable of producing Light: So that the Idea they have of the Faculty of Light, is not different from the general Idea of the Cauſe, and confuſed Idea of the Effect which we ſee. They have therefore no clear Idea of what they ſay, when they admit theſe particular Beings. Thus they ſay what they conceive not, and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is impoſſible to be conceived.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the moſt dangerous Error in Philoſophy. Of the Ancients.</head>
                        <p>PHiloſophers have not only ſpoke what they did not conceive, when they explained the Effects of Nature, by certain Beings which they have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Idea of, but even eſtabliſh a Principle from whence may directly be drawn moſt falſe and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences.</p>
                        <p>For if, according to their Opinion, we ſuppoſe, that in Bodies there are ſome Beings diſtinct from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and not having any diſtinct Idea of theſe Entities, we might eaſily imagine, that they are the true, or principal Cauſes of the Effects which we ſee produced. 'Tis even the common Sentiment of moſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: For 'tis chiefly to explain theſe Effects, that they make uſe of Subſtantial Forms, Real Qualities, and other the like Entities. But when we come to conſider attentively, the Idea we have of <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of acting, we cannot doubt but that it repreſents ſomething Divine: For the Idea of a Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is the Idea of Sovereign Divinity; and the Idea of a Subordinate Power, is the Idea of an inferiour; but a true Divinity at leaſt, according to the Opinion of the Heathens, if it be the Idea of a Power or true Cauſe. We admit therefore ſomething Divine in all Bodies which encompaſs us, when we admit Forms, Faculties, Qualities, Vertues, and real Beings, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of producing certain Effects, by the Power of their own Nature: And thus, they inſenſibly enter into the Opinions of the Heathens, by the Reſpect they have for their Philoſophy. Faith indeed works it, but it may perhaps be ſaid, that if we are Chriſtians in our Hearts, we are Heathens in our Minds.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it is difficult to perſwade our ſelves, that we ought neither to love or fear, true Powers
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107782:90"/>and Beings, who can act upon us, puniſh us with Pain, or recompenſe us with Pleaſure. And as Love and Fear are a true Adoration, 'tis alſo difficult to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves that we ought not to adore them. For whatever can act upon us, as a real and true Cauſe, is neceſſarily above us, according to St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> and right Reaſon: The ſame Father, and the ſame Reaſon tells us, 'tis an immutable Law that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things ſhould ſubmit to ſuperiour. And from hence,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ego enim ab animâ hoc corpus animari non puto, nifi intentione facientis: Nec ab iſto quicquam illam pati Arbitror, ſed facere de illo &amp; in illo, tanquam ſubjecto divinitus domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationi ſuae.</hi> l. 6. mus. c. 5.</note> * this great Father concludes, that the Body cannot act upon the Soul, and that nothing can be above the Soul but God.</p>
                        <p>In the Holy Scriptures, when God proves to the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> that they ought to adore him, that is, that they ought to fear and love him, the chief Reaſons he brings, are taken from his Power, to recompence and puniſh them. He repreſents to them the Benefits they have received from him, the Evils wherewith he hath chaſtiſed them, and that he has ſtill the ſame Power. He forbids them to adore the Gods of the Heathens, becauſe they have no Power over them, and can do them neither Good nor Hurt. He requires them to honour him only, becauſe he only is the true Cauſe of Good and Evil, and that there happens none in their City, according to the Prophet, which he has not done; for Natural Cauſes are not the true Cauſes of the Evil that appears to be done to us. 'Tis God alone that acts in them, and 'tis he only that we muſt fear and love: <hi>Soli Deo Honor &amp; Gloria.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In ſhort, this Opinion, that we ought to fear and love, whatſoever is the true Cauſe of Good and Evil, appears ſo natural and juſt, that it is impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it; ſo that if we ſuppoſe this falſe Opinion of the Philoſophers (which we endeavour here to confute) that Bodies which encompaſs us are the true Cauſes of the Pleaſures and Evils which we feel: Reaſon ſeems to juſtifie a Religion like to that of the Heathens,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107782:90"/>and approves of the univerſal Irregularity of Manners.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that Reaſon does not tell us that we muſt adore Onyons and Leeks, as the Sovereign Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; becauſe they cannot make us intirely happy when we have of them, or intirely unhappy when we want them. Nor have the Heathens ever done to them ſo much Honour as to the great <hi>Jupiter,</hi> upon whom all their Divinities depend, or as to the Sun, which our Senſes repreſent to us, as the univerſal Cauſe, which gives Life and Motion to all things, and, which we cannot hinder our ſelves from regarding as a Sovereign Divinity; if with the Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, we ſuppoſe it includes in its being the true Cauſes of whatever it ſeems to produce, not only in our Bodies and Minds, but likewiſe in all Beings which encompaſs us.</p>
                        <p>But if we muſt not pay a Sovereign Honour to Leeks and Onyons, yet we may always render them ſome particular Adoration: I mean, we may think of and love them in ſome manner; if it is true, that in ſome ſort they can make us happy, we muſt honour them in Proportion to the Good they can do us. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Men who give Ear to the Reports of their Senſes, think that Pulſe is capable of doing them good; for elſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> for inſtance, would not have regretted their Abſence in the Defect, nor conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it as a Misfortune to be deprived of them, if they did not, in ſome manner, look upon themſelves happy in the Enjoyment of them. Theſe are the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities which our Reaſon engages us in, when it is joyned to the Principles of the Heathen Philoſophy, and follows the Impreſſons of the Senſes.</p>
                        <p>That we may longer doubt of the Falſeneſs of this Miſerable Philoſphy, and the Certainty of our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Clearneſs of the Idea's we make uſe of: It is neceſſary, clearly to eſtabliſh thoſe Truths which are oppoſite to the Errors of the ancient Philoſophy, and to prove, in ſhort, that there is only one true Cauſe, becauſe there is only one true God: That Nature, or the Power of every thing, proceeds only from the Will
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107782:91"/>of God: That all Natural things are not true Cauſes, but only occaſional ones; and ſome other Truths which will be the Conſequences of theſe.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that all Bodies, both great and ſmall, have no power of removing themſelves: A Mountain, an Houſe, a Stone, a grain of Sand; and in ſhort, the leaſt or biggeſt Bodies we can conceive, have no power of removing themſelves. We have only two ſorts of Idea's, that of Bodies, and that of Spirits; whereas we ought to ſpeak only of thoſe things which we conceive we ſhould reaſon according to theſe two Idea's. Since therefore the Idea we have of all Bodies, ſhows us that they cannot move themſelves, it muſt be concluded that they are moved by Spirits only. But when we examine the Idea we have of all finite Minds, we do not ſee the neceſſary Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Wills and the Motion of any Body what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be: On the contrary, we ſee that there is none, nor can be any; whence we ought to conclude, if we will argue according to our Knowledge, that as no body can be able to move it ſelf, ſo there is no created Spirit can be the true or principal cauſe of the Motion of any body whatever.</p>
                        <p>But when we think of the Idea of God, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Being infinitely Perfect, and conſequently Almighty, we know that there is ſuch a Connexion between his Will, and the Motion of all Bodies, that 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive he ſhould Will the Motion of a Body, that ſhould not be moved: We muſt then ſay, that his Will only can move Bodies, if we will ſpeak things as we conceive them, and not as we feel them. The moving force of Bodies therefore, is not in the Bodies which move, ſince this power of Motion is nothing elſe but the Will of God. Thus Bodies have no Action, and when a Bowl which is moved, by meeting it moves another, yet it communicates nothing of its own; for in it ſelf it hath not the Impreſſion that it communicates to the other: Yet a Bowl is the Natural Cauſe of the motion which it communicates. A Natural Cauſe then is not a real and true Cauſe, but only an occaſional one, and which determined the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107782:91"/>Author of Nature to act after ſuch and ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in ſuch and ſuch an Occurrence.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that 'tis by the Motion of viſible or inviſible. Bodies that all things are produced: For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teaches us, that Bodies, whoſe parts are in greateſt Motion, always act more than others, and produce the greateſt Change in the World. All the Powers of Nature then proceed from the Will of God: He has created the World becauſe he willed it: <hi>Dixit &amp; facta ſunt:</hi> He moves all things, and ſo produces all the Effects that we ſee happen; becauſe he has alſo willed certain Laws, according to which Bodies communicate their Motions in their Rencounter; and becauſe theſe Laws are Efficacious they act, and Bodies cannot act. There is therefore no Force, Power, or true Cauſe, in the Material and Senſible World, nor muſt we admit of Forms, Facilities, and real Qualities, to produce Effects that Bodies cannot; and to divide, with God, the Force and Power which is Eſſential to him. Not only Bodies cannot be the true Cauſes of any thing, the moſt noble Spirits alſo are under a like Impotence. They can know nothing it God does not enlighten them; nor can they have any Senſation if he does not modifie them. They are capable of willing nothing if God moves them not towards him. I confeſs they can determine the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that God gives them towards him, to other Objects; but I know not whether that can called a Power. If the Capability of Sinning is a Power, it would be a Power which the Almighty has not. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays in ſome of his Works, It Men had in themſelves the Power of loving Good, we might ſay they had ſome Power: But can only Love, becauſe God Wills they ſhould Love, and becauſe his Will is Efficacious. They Love only, becauſe God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually inclines them to Good in General; that is, towards himſelf: For God has created them only for himſelf, he never preſerves them without turning them towards and inclining them to himſelf. They have no Motion towards Good in general, 'tis God who moves them; they only follow by an entire free
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107782:92"/>Choice, this Impreſſion according to the Law of God, or determine it towards a falſe Good after the Law of the Fleſh: They can only be determined by a Proſpect of Good: For being able to do only what God makes them, they can love nothing but Good.</p>
                        <p>But if we ſhould ſuppoſe what is true in one Senſe, that Spirits have in themſelves the Power of knowing Truth and loving Good, if their Thoughts and Wills produced nothing External, we might always ſay they were able to do nothing. Now it appears moſt certain to me, that the Will of Spirits is not capable of moving the leaſt Body in the World: For 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there is no neceſſary Connexion between the Will we have of moving our Arms, and the Motion of them. It is true, they are moved when we pleaſe, and by that means we are the Natural Cauſe of their Motion: But Natural Cauſes are not true Cauſes, they are only Occaſional ones, which act meerly through the Power and Efficacy of God, as I have already explained.</p>
                        <p>For how can we move our Arms? To move them we muſt have Animal Spirits, and convey them by certain Nerves, into ſuch and ſuch Muſcles to ſwell and contract them. For by this means the Arms move; or according to the Opinion of ſome, we know not yet how 'tis performed: And we ſee, that Men who do not ſo much as know they have Spirits, Nerves, and Muſcles to move their Arms, yet move them with as much Art and Facility, as thoſe that underſtand Anatomy beſt. 'Tis then granted, that Men Will the Motion of their Arms, but 'tis only God that can and knows how to remove them. If a Man cannot throw down a Tower, at leaſt he knows well what muſt be done in order to it: But there is no Man that knows ſo much, as what he muſt do to move one of his Fingers by the help of his Animal Spirits. How then can Men move their Arms? Theſe things appear evident to me, and to all thoſe that will think of them, though perhaps they may be incomprehenſible to ſuch as will not conſider them.</p>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:107782:92"/>
                        <p>But Men only are not the True Cauſes of the Motions produced in their Bodies, it ſeems even a Contradiction that they ſhould be ſo. A True Cauſe is ſuch an one as the Mind perceives a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between it and its Effect; 'tis that I mean. Now there is only the Infinitely Perfect Being, whoſe Mind can perceive a neceſſary Connexion between his Will and the Effects of it. 'Tis only God then, who is the True Cauſe, and who has really the Power of moving Bodies. I ſay moreover, 'tis not probable that God ſhould communicate, either to Men or Angels, this Power he has of moving Bodies; and thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Power we have of moving our Arms is a true Power, muſt confeſs that God can alſo give to Spirits the Power of creating, annihilating, and performing all poſſible things: In a word, That he can make them Almighty, as I ſhall further ſhew.</p>
                        <p>God has no need of any Inſtrument to act, it is ſufficient if he Wills a thing for it to be, becauſe it is a Contradiction to ſuppoſe he Wills it, and that it ſhould not be. His Power then is his Will, and the communicating of his Power is a Communication of his Will. But to communicate his Will to a Man or an Angel, can ſignifie nothing elſe but Willing; ſome body, for inſtance, ſhould be effectively moved when 'tis Will'd by a Man or an Angel. Now in this caſe I ſee two Wills which concur when an Angel would move a Body, that of God, and that of the Angel; and to know which of the two will be the true Cauſe of the Motion of this Body, we muſt know which it is that is Efficacious. There is a neceſſary Connexion between the Will of God, and what he Wills. God Wills in this caſe, that a Body ſhould move when it is willed by an Angel: There is a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion therefore, between the. Will of God and the Motion of this Body; and conſequently 'tis God who is the true cauſe of the Motion of the Body, and the Will of the Angel only an occaſional one.</p>
                        <p>But to ſhew it yet more clearly, let us ſuppoſe that God Wills it ſhould happen quite contrary to what ſome Spirits deſire; as we may think of Devils, or
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107782:93"/>ſome other Spirits, who merit this Puniſhment; we cannot ſay in this caſe, that God communicates his Power to them, ſince they can do nothing that they would do. Yet the Wills of theſe Spirits would be the Natural Cauſes of whatever Effects ſhould be produced; as ſuch Bodies ſhould be moved to the Right Hand, becauſe theſe Spirits would have them moved to the Left; and the deſire of theſe Spirits would determine the Will of God to act, as our Wills to move the parts of our Bodies, determine the firſt Cauſe to move them: So that the Wills of Spirits are only occaſional Cauſes.</p>
                        <p>Yet if after all theſe Reaſons, we will ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Will of an Angel, which moves any body, ſhould be a true Cauſe, and not an occasional one; it is plain that this ſame Angel might be the true Cauſe of the Creation and Annihilation of all things: For God could as well communicate to him his Prower of Creating and Deſtroying Bodies, as that of moving them, if he will'd that things ſhould be created and annihilated: In a word, If he will'd that all things ſhould happen as the Angel wiſhes them, even as he Wills Bodies ſhould move, as the Angel pleaſes. If it be ſaid, that an Angel or a Man would be the true movers, becauſe God moves Bodies when they wiſh it; it may alſo be ſaid, that a Man and an Angel may be true Creators, ſince God can create Beings when they will it: Nay, perhaps it might be ſaid, that the molt Vile Animals, or Matter of it ſelf, ſhould be the effective Cauſe of the Creation of any Subſtance; if we ſuppoſed as the Philoſophers do, that God produces ſubſtantial Forms whenever the Diſpoſition of Matter requires it. In fine, Becauſe God has reſolved from all Eternity in certain times to create ſuch or ſuch things, we might alſo ſay, that theſe times ſhould be the Cauſes of the Creation of theſe Beings, as reaſonably as to pretend, that a Bowl which meets another, is the true cauſe of the motion it communicates to it: Becauſe God has determined by his general Will, which conſtituted the Order of Nature, that when two Bodies ſhould meet
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107782:93"/>there ſhould be ſuch and ſuch a Communication of Motion.</p>
                        <p>There is then but one only true God, and he the one only true Cauſe: And we muſt not imagine, that which precedes an Effect, to be the true Cauſe of it. God cannot even communicate his Power to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if we follow the Light of Reaſon; he cannot make them true Cauſes, becauſe he cannot make them Gods. Bodies, Spirits, pure Intelligences, can all do nothing. 'Tis he who hath made theſe Spirits that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminates and acts them. 'Tis he who has created the Heavens and the Earth, which regulates the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof. In ſhort, 'tis the Author of our Being that executes our Wills, <hi>ſemel juſſit, ſemper paret.</hi> He even moves our Arms when we make uſe of them againſt his Orders, for he complains by his Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we make him ſerve our unjuſt and criminal Deſires.</p>
                        <p>All theſe little Heathen Divinities, and all theſe particular Cauſes of the Philoſophers, are only Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's that the wicked Spirit endeavours to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh to ruin the Worſhip of the true God. It is not the Philoſophy they have received from <hi>Adam,</hi> which teaches theſe things; 'tis that they have received from the Serpent; for ſince the Fall, the Mind of Man is perfectly Heatheniſh. 'Tis this Philoſophy which joyned to the Errors of the Senſes, has made them adore the Sun, and which is fall at this Day, the univerſal Cauſe of the Irregularity of the Mind, and Corruption of the Heart of Man. By their Actions, and ſometimes by their Words; why ſay they, ſhould we not love the Body, ſince the Body is capable of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording us all Pleaſures? And why do we laugh at the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which regretted the Loſs of the Garlick and Onyons of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſince, in Effect, they were unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, by being deprived of what, in ſome Meaſure, could make them happy? But the new Philoſophy, which they repreſent as a diſmal thing, to affrighten weak Minds, that is deſpiſed and condemned without being underſtood. The new Philoſophy, I ſay, ſince they are pleaſed to call it ſo, deſtroys all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107782:94"/>of the Libertines, by the Eſtabliſhment of the chiefeſt of its Principles, which perfectly agrees with the<note n="*" place="margin">Haec eſt Religio Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, fratres mei, quae praedicatur per univerſum mundum horrentibus inimieis, &amp; ubi vincuntur murmurantibus, ubi praevalent ſaevientibus, haec eſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie Chriſtiana ut, <hi>Colatur unus Deus non Dii, qui facit Animam Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum niſi unus Deus.</hi> Aug. tr. <hi>23.</hi> in Joan.</note> firſt Principle of the Chriſtian Religion, that we muſt love and fear but one God, ſince there is only one God who can make us happy.</p>
                        <p>For if Religion teaches us, that there is but one true God, this Philoſophy ſhews us there is but one true Cauſe. If Religion informs us, that all the Divinities of the Heathens are only Stones and Metals without Life and Motion: This Philoſophy diſcovers to us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that all ſecond Cauſes, or all the Divinities of their Philoſophy, are only Matter and inefficacious Wills. In ſhort, if Religion teaches us, that we muſt not bow our Knees to falſe Gods. This Philoſophy alſo tells us, that our Imaginations and Minds ought not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to the Imaginary Greatneſs and Power of Cauſes, which are not true Cauſes: That we muſt neither love nor fear them, nor buſie our ſelves about them; but think upon God only, ſee him, adore him, fear and love him in all things.</p>
                        <p>But this agrees not with the Inclination of ſome Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers: They will neither ſee nor think upon God: For ſince the Fall, there is a ſecret Oppoſition between God and Man: Men take Pleaſure in erecting Gods after their own Fancy, they voluntarily love and fear the Fictions of their own Imagination, as they Heathens did the Works of their own Hands. They are like Children who tremble at their Companions, after they have daubed their Faces: Or if they will have a more Noble Compariſon, although perhaps it be not ſo juſt, they reſemble thoſe famous <hi>Romans,</hi> who had ſome Fear and Reſpect for the Fictions of their own Minds, and fooliſhly adored their Emperors after they had let looſe the Eagle when they deified them.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> An Explanation of the Second Part of the general Rule. That Philoſophers neglect it, but Mr. <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> has very exactly obſerved it.</head>
                        <p>WE have already ſhewed unto what Errors we are ſubject, when we reaſon upon the falſe and confuſed Idea's of the Senſes; and upon the rambling and indeterminate Idea's of pure Logick. We have ſufficiently diſcovered, that to preſerve Evidence in our Perceptions, it is abſolutely neceſſary exactly to obſerve the Rule that we have preſcribed, if our Idea's are clear and diſtinct, and then to reaſon according to theſe Idea's.</p>
                        <p>In this ſame general Rule, which reſpects the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Studies, there is yet this Circumſtance to be well conſidered: Namely, that we muſt always begin with the moſt ſimple and eaſie things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a long Time upon them, before we undertake more compounded and difficult ones. For if we muſt only reaſon upon diſtinct Idea's always to preſerve Evidence in our Perceptions; it is plain, that we muſt never proceed to an Enquiry after compounded things, before we have very carefully examined, and made thoſe ſimple ones, on which they depend, familiar to us. Since the Idea's of compounded things, neither are nor can be clear, when we have only a confuſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Knowledge of the more ſimple which compoſe them.</p>
                        <p>We know things imperfectly, when we are not aſſured that we have conſidered all their Parts: And we have a confuſed Knowledge of them, when they are not familiar to the Mind, although we are certain we have examined them in all their Parts, When we know them but imperfectly, we only reaſon upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities; when we perceive them confuſedly, there is neither Order nor Underſtanding in out Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107782:95"/>We often know neither where we are, nor where we go. But when we know them imperfectly and confuſedly together, which happens moſt commonly; we have neither a clear Knowledge of what we enquire after, nor the means of attaining it. So that it's abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to keep ſtrictly to this Order in our Studies. <hi>To begin always with the moſt ſimple things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all their Parts, and make them familiar to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we paſs to the more compounded on which they depend.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this Rule agrees not with Mens Inclinations, they naturally have a Contempt for whatever appears eaſie; and their Mind which was not made for a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Object that may be eaſily comprehend, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtop long in conſidering theſe ſimple Idea's, which have no Character of Infinity for which they are made. On the contrary, and for the ſame Reaſon, they have much Reſpect and Inclination for great things which include ſomething of Infinity, and ſuch things as are obſcure and myſterious. 'Tis not becauſe they love Darkneſs, but 'tis that in this Darkneſs they hope to find a Good and a Truth capable of ſatisfying them.</p>
                        <p>Vanity alſo inclines the Mind immediately to imploy it ſelf about great and extraordinary things; and gives it a Fooliſh Hope of accompliſhing whatever it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes. Experience ſhews us, That the moſt exact Knowledge of common things gives no Reputation in the World, and that the Knowledge of ſuch things as are uncommon, how confuſed and imperfect ſoever it may be, always gains Eſteem and Reſpect to thoſe, who freely expreſs ſome high Idea of what they underſtand not. And this Experience determines all thoſe, who are more ſenſibly touched with Vanity than Truth (who are certainly in the greateſt Number) to make a blind Enquiry after a ſpecious and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knowledge of whatever is great, rare, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.</p>
                        <p>How many Men reject the Philoſophy of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> for this pleaſant Reaſon, that his Principles are too ſimple and eaſie, There are no obſcure and myſterious
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107782:95"/>Terms in this Philoſophy: Women, and Perſons who know neither Greek nor Latin, are capable of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending it: It muſt therefore be of very ſmall Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and it would not be reaſonable for great <hi>Genii</hi> to apply themſelves to it. They imagine Principles ſo clear and ſimple, are not extenſive enough to explain the Effects of Nature, which they ſuppoſe obſcure and perplexed. They do not immediately ſee the Benefit of theſe Principles, which are too eaſie and ſimple to ſtop their Attention, ſo long as it is neceſſary to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Uſe and Extent of them. They rather chooſe to explain thoſe Effects, whoſe Cauſes they do not comprehend, by Principles they conceive not; and which it is abſolutely impoſſible to conceive, than by ſuch as are both ſimple and intelligible. For theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers explain obſcure things, by Principles which are not only obſcure, but alſo intirely incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                        <p>When any Perſons undertake to explain things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly perplexed, by clear and known Principles, it is eaſie to ſee whether or no they accompliſh it, becauſe if we conceive well what they ſay, we can diſcover whether or no they ſpeak true. So the faſly Learned would not find their Expectation, nor make themſelves admired as they wiſh to be, if they made uſe of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Principles; becauſe it would evidently be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that they ſay nothing. But when they make uſe of unknown Principles, and ſpeak of very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded things, as if they exactly knew all their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they are admired, becauſe what they ſay is not conceived, and we naturally have a Reſpect for what paſſes our Underſtandings.</p>
                        <p>Now, as obſcure and incomprehenſible things ſeem to be better connected, than ſuch as are clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible: Incomprehenſible Principles are of a greater Uſe than intelligible ones, in the moſt compounded Queſtions. There is nothing ſo difficult but Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Phyſicians give ſome brief Reaſon of it from their Principles: For their Principles being yet more incomprehenſible, than all the Queſtions that can be put to them, if they be once taken for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107782:96"/>granted, there is no Difficulty but will ſoon be ſolved.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, they boldly, and without any Heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anſwer theſe obſcure and indetermined Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Why is it that the Sun attracts. Vapours? That the Jeſuits Powder cures the Quartan Feaver? That Ruburb purges Choler? Chymical Salt, Flegm? And other like Queſtions. And the Generality of Mankind are ſatisfied with their Anſwers, becauſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and incomprehenſible agrees with both. But unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Principles do not well agree with Queſtions that are clearly propoſed, and eaſily reſolved; becauſe it is evidently diſcovered, that they ſignifie nothing. Theſe Philoſophers cannot, by their Principles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, how Horſes draw a Chariot; how Duſt ſtops a Watch; how Trepoly cleanſes Metals, and a Bruſh out Cloaths. For they would make themſelves ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to all the World, if they ſuppoſed a Notion of Attraction, and <hi>attractive</hi> Faculties to explain the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Chariots follow the Horſes which are faſtned to them, and a <hi>deterſive</hi> Faculty in Bruſhes for clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cloaths, and ſo of other Queſtions. Therefore their great Principles are uſeleſs, except in, obſcure Queſtions, becauſe they are incomprehenſible.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not therefore ſtop at any of all theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which we have not an evident and clear Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, and which we may think ſome Nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not. We muſt attentively conſider the Idea's we have of Extenſion, Figure, Local Motion, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation theſe things have amongſt themſelves. If we conceive theſe Idea's diſtinctly, and find them ſo clear, that we are perſwaded, that all Nations have always received them, we muſt reſt here, and examine all their Relations: But if we find them obſcure, we muſt ſeek after others. For if to reaſon without Fear of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving our ſelves, it is always neceſſary to preſerve Evidence in our Perceptions, we muſt only reaſon upon clear Idea's, and their Relations diſtinctly known.</p>
                        <p>In order to conſider the Properties of Extenſion, we muſt with M. <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> begin with the moſt ſimple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107782:96"/>and paſs from the more ſimple to the more compounded; not only becauſe this Method is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and aſſiſts the Mind in theſe Operations, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God always acts in this Order, and by the moſt ſimple Way; this Manner of examining our Idea's, and their Relations, will the better diſcover his Works to us. And if we conſider that the moſt ſimple Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are always thoſe which are firſt repreſented to the Imagination, when it is not determined rather to think of one thing than on another: We ſhall diſcover, that it will be enough to conſider things attentively and without Prejudice, to enter into this Order that we preſcribe, and to diſcover the moſt compounded Truths, provided we do not run too faſt from one Subject to another.</p>
                        <p>If then we attentively conſider Extenſion; without much Difficulty we perceive that one Part may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from another, we eaſily conceive Local Motion, and that this Local Motion produces a Figure in both Bodies which are moved. Of all Motions, the moſt ſimple, and firſt, which preſents it ſelf to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, the Motion of a right Line: Let us ſuppoſe then, that there is ſome Part of Extenſion moved in a right Line, it will neceſſarily diſplace ſome other Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matter which it finds in its Way, and this laſt ſhall move Circularly to take the Place that the other leaves, and by that means make a Circular Motion. But if we conceive an infinite Number of Motions in a right Line, in an infinite Number of the like Parts of this immenſe Extenſion which we would confider; It is yet neceſſary, that all theſe Bodies hinder one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſpiring all by their mutual Action and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action; I mean by the mutual Communication of all their particular Motions, to produce one that is Circular.</p>
                        <p>This firſt Conſideration of the moſt ſimple Relations of our Idea's, already diſcover to us, the Neceſſity of Mr. <hi>Deſcartes</hi> Vortices: And their Number will be ſo much the greater, as the Motions of all the Parts of Extenſion in a right Line, having been the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other, they ſhall have had more Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107782:97"/>to agree in the ſame Motion; and that of all theſe <hi>Vortices,</hi> thoſe will be the greateſt, which have had more Parts conſpire to the ſame Motion, or whoſe Parts ſhould have had more Power to continue their Motion in a right Line.</p>
                        <p>But Care muſt be taken that the Mind is neither fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued nor diſſipated, by fruitleſly applying it to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Number, and immenſe Magnitudes of Vortices: We muſt firſt apply our ſelves ſome Time upon one of theſe Vortices, and enquire orderly and attentively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Motions of the Matter it includes, and all the Figures wherewith all the Parts of that Matter ought to be endued.</p>
                        <p>As there is no ſimple Motion bur that in a right Line, we muſt firſt confider this Motion, as that according to which all Bodies inceſſantly tend to move in, ſince God always acts according to the moſt ſimple Ways, and that in Effect Bodies are circularly moved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they find continual Oppoſition in their direct Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So all Bodies, not being of an equal Magnitude, and thoſe which are the greateſt, having more Power to continue their Motion in a right Line than others; we eaſily conceive, that the leaſt Bodies muſt be near the Center of the Vortex, and the greateſt towards the Circumference: Since the Lines which we conceive to be deſcribed by the Motion of Bodies, which are at the Circumference, approach more to a right Line, than thoſe the Bodies deſcribe, which are nearer the Center.</p>
                        <p>If we again think, that each Part of this Matter could not be moved at firſt, and in its Motion endure a perpetual Oppoſition, but be made round, and have its Corners broke; we ſhould eaſily diſcover, that all this Extenſion would be only compoſed of two Sorts of Bodies: Round Balls which inceſſantly turn upon their Center, after many different Manners, and which, beſides their particular Motion, are alſo hurried on by the common Motion of thc Vortex; and with a more flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id and more agitated Matter, which is produced by the rubbing of the Balls before mentioned: Beſides, the Circular Motion, common to all Parts of the Vortix,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107782:97"/>this ſubtil Matter will ſtill have a particular Motion, almoſt in a right Line from the Center of the Vortex, to rhe Circumference, by the Intervals of the Balls which leave it a free Paſſage: So that the Motion compounded of theſe Motions, will be in a Spiral Line. This fluid Matter that M. <hi>Deſcartes</hi> calls the <hi>Firſt Element,</hi> being divided into little Parts, which have much leſs Power to continue their Motion in a right Line, than the Balls or <hi>Second Element:</hi> It is evident, that the firſt Element muſt be in the Center of the Vortex, and fill the empty Spaces which are between the Parts of the ſecond, and that the Parts of the ſecond muſt fill the reſt of the Vortex, and approach to its Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Proportion to the Magnitude or Power they have to continue their Motion in a right Line. As to the Figure of the whole Vortex, we cannot doubt from what has been ſaid, that the Diſtance of one Pole to the other, will be ſhorter than the Lines which go croſs the<note n="*" place="margin">By <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> I mean the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est curve Line that the Matter of the Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes.</note> Equator. And if we conſider that the Vortices ſurrround and compreſs each other unequally, we ſhall alſo clearly ſee, that their Equator is an irregular curve Line very much like an Elipſis.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things Naturally preſent themſelves to the Mind, when we attentively conſider what muſt happen to the Parts of Extenſion, which continually incline to move in a right Line; that is in the moſt ſimple of all Motions. If we would now ſuppoſe a thing which ſeems moſt worthy the Wiſdom and Power of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That he hath, in an inſtant, formed the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in the ſame Condition that its Parts would in Time, have been diſpoſed in by the moſt ſimple Ways, and that he alſo preſerves them by the ſame Natural Laws: In ſhort, if we would apply our Thoughts to the Objects we ſee; we might judge the Sun to be the Center of the Vortex: That the Corporeal Light it diffuſes on all ſides, is nothing elſe but the continual Effort of little Globules, which incline to ſeparate themſelves from the Center of the Vortex; and that this Light muſt be communicated by immenſe Spaces in an inſtant, becauſe the whole being full of theſe Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules one of them cannot be preſſed, without
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107782:98"/>the Motion of all the reſt that are oppoſite to it.</p>
                        <p>We may ſtill deduce many other Conſequences from what I have ſaid: For the moſt ſimple Principles are the moſt proper to explain his Works, who always acts according to the moſt ſimple Ways: But we have occaſion yet to conſider certain things which muſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Matter. We ought then to think that there is more Vortices like to that we have given a ſhort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of; that the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Centers of theſe Vortices are Stars, which are as ſo many Suns: That the Vortices encompaſs one another, and are diſpoſed after ſuch a manner as to prejudice each others Motion as little as can be: But things have not been able to come to that paſs, but the weakeſt Vortices have been drawn along, and almoſt ſwallowed up by the ſtrongeſt.</p>
                        <p>To apprehend which, we need only reflect, that the firſt Element, which is in the Center of a Vortix, may, and continually does, get out by the Spaces of the Balls towards the Circumference of the ſame Vortix, and that at the Time that this Center or Star empties it ſelf through its Equator, the other firſt Element muſt re-enter by its Poles. For neither the Star nor its Poles can be emptied on one ſide without being filled on the other; ſince there is no Void in Extenſion. But becauſe an infinite Number of Cauſes can hinder much of the firſt Element, from entring into this Star which we ſpeak of: It is requiſite that the Parts of the firſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are obliged to remain in it, ſhould be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as to move the ſame Way. 'Tis that which makes them unite and joyn one with another, and form Spots, which condenſe into Cruſts, and by little and little cover the Center, and make a ſolid and groſs Matter, of the moſt ſubtle and agitated of all Bodies. 'Tis this groſs Matter that Mr. <hi>Deſcartes</hi> calls the <hi>third Element;</hi> and it muſt be obſerved, that as it proceeds from the firſt, whoſe Figures are infinite, it ought to be inveſted with an infinite Number of different Forms.</p>
                        <p>This Star, thus covered with Spots and Cruſts, and become like the other Planets, is no longer able to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107782:98"/>maintain and defend its Vortex againſt the continual Effort of thoſe that environ it. This Vortex therefore diminiſhes by little and little. The Matter which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it, is diſperſed on all ſides; and the ſtrongeſt Vortex about it, draws the greateſt Part of it, and at laſt ſwallows up the Planet which was the Center of it. This Planet being encompaſſed with the Matter of the great Vortex, it ſwims there to preſerve it ſelf with ſome little Matter of its own Vortex, keeping the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Motion it had before: And at laſt it takes a Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation there, which puts it in Equilibrio with an equal Quantity of Matter in which it ſwims. If it has but a little Solidity and Magnitude left, it deſcends very near to the Center of the Vortex which ſwallowed it up; becauſe, having ſome Power to continue its Motion in a right Line, it muſt place it ſelf in this Vortex, in which an equal Quantity of the ſecond Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has as much Power as it has to remove it ſelf from the Center, for it can be in Equilibrio only in this Place. If this Planet is greater or more ſolid, it will be in Equilibrio with a Place more diſtant from the Center of the Vortex. And in ſhort, if in this Vortex there is any Place, or equal Quantity of Matter that has as much Solidity as this Planet, and conſequently, as much Power to continue its Motion in a right Line, becauſe this Planet will, perhaps, be very great, and covered with very ſolid and thick Cruſts; it cannot ſtop in this Vortex, ſince it cannot be put in Equilibrio with the Matter which compoſes it. This Planet will paſs then into ſome other Vortex, and if it cannot be in Equilibrio, it will not ſtay there neither. So that we ſhall ſee it ſometimes paſs like Comets, when they happen to be in our Vortex, and near enough for us to diſcern them: And we ſhall not ſee it again till a long time after, when it is in other Vortices, or in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of ours.</p>
                        <p>If we how think that one Vortix alone, by its Magnitude, Force, and Advantagious Situation, can by little and little undermine, attract, and ſwallow up many Vortices, and ſuch Vortices which before had ſwallowed ſome others; it would be neceſſary that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107782:99"/>the Planets which are in the Centers of theſe Vortices, being entered into the great Vortex which has ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them up, ſhould be there put in Equilibrio with an equal Quantity of Matter in which they ſwim. So that if theſe Planets are unequal in Solidity, they will be in an unequal Diſtance from the Center or the Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex in which they ſwim. And if it be found, that two Planets have near the ſame Power to continue their Motion in a right Line, or that one Planet draws into its little Vortex, one, or many other leſs Planets, which, according to our Manner of conceiving the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of things it has ſwallowed up, then this little Planet ſhall turn about the great one while that turns upon its Center; and all theſe Planets ſhall be carried along by the Motion of the great Vortex, in almoſt an equal Diſtance from its Center.</p>
                        <p>We are obliged, by the Light of Reaſon, ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Parts which compoſe the World, that we imagine to have been formed by the moſt ſimple Ways. For all that we have ſaid is grounded only upon the Idea we have of Extenſion, the Parts of which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to incline to the moſt ſimple Motion, which is that of a right Line. And when we examine by the Effects, whether we are not deceived, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to explain things by their Cauſes, we areas much ſurprized to ſee the Phenomena of Celeſtial Bodies ſo perfectly agree with what we have ſaid: For we ſee that all the Planets that are in the Middle of a little Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex, turn upon their own Center, like the Sun; that they ſwim all in the Vortex of the Sun, and about the Sun; that the ſmalleſt, or leaſt ſolid, are neareſt the Sun; and the more ſolid are at the greateſt Diſtance from it; and that there is alſo ſome amongſt them like Comets, which cannot remain in the Vortex of the Sun: In ſhort, there are many Planets, which yet have many little ones that turn about them, as the Moon does about the Earth. <hi>Jupiter</hi> has four of them, and <hi>Saturn</hi> three. It may be alſo, that <hi>Saturn</hi> has ſo great a Number of ſmall ones, that they form a continued Circle, which ſeems to have no Thickneſs, becauſe of its great Diſtance. Theſe Planets being the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107782:99"/>greateſt that we ſee, we may conſider them as having been engendered of Vortices large enough to have ſwallowed up others before they were involved in the Vortices we are in.</p>
                        <p>All theſe Planets turn upon their Center, the. Earth in Twenty Four Hours, <hi>Mars</hi> in Twenty Five, or near, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in Ten Hours, or thereabouts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They turn about the Sun, <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, in about Four Months: <hi>Saturn,</hi> which is the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off, in Thirty Years near; and thoſe which are between both, in more or leſs Time, but not perfectly in the Proportion of their Diſtance. For all the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in which they ſwim, turns ſwifter when it is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the Sun, becauſe the Line of its Motion is then ſhorter. When <hi>Mars</hi> is oppoſite to the Sun, he is very near the Earth, and very diſtant when he is joyned to the Sun: It is the ſame with the Superiour Planets, <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn;</hi> as for the Inferiout ones, ſuch as <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> to ſpeak properly, they are never oppoſite to the Sun. The Lines that all Planets ſeem to deſcribe about the Earth, are not Circles; but they approach very near to Elipſes, and all theſe Elipſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very different, becauſe of the different Situation of the Planets, in reſpect to us: In ſhort, all that we obſerve in the Heavens, with any Certainty concerning the Motion of the Planets, agrees perfectly well with what we have ſaid of their Formation, according to the moſt ſimple Ways.</p>
                        <p>As for the fixed Stars, Experience tells us, ſome of them diminiſh and intirely diſappear, and ſome of them alſo there are, which appear anew, whoſe Brightneſs and Magnitude much augments. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or diminiſh as the Vortices do, of which they are the Centers, and receive more or leſs of the firſt Element. We ceaſe to ſee them, when they are made up of Spots and Cruſts', and begin again to diſcover them, when theſe Spots which hindered their ſhining, are wholly diſſipated. All theſe Stars keep near the ſame Diſtance amongſt themſelves, ſince they are the Centers of Vortexes, and are not drawn ſo much as they reſiſt other Vortexes, or as the Stars are. They
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107782:100"/>all ſhine like Suns, becauſe like the Sun, they are the Centers of ſome Vortexes, which are not yet ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. They are all equally diſtant from the Earth, although they appear to the Eye as faſtned to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Surface: For if we have not yet compared the Parallax of the neareſt, with that of the moſt diſtant, by the different Situation of the Earth from ſix Months to ſix Months, it is becauſe this Difference of Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not great enough to render this Parallax ſenſible, becauſe of the Diſtance we are from the Stars. It may be by the means of Teleſcopes ſome ſmall matter might be obſerved. In fine, all that we can diſcover in the Stars by our Senſes, and Experience, is not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what we have diſcovered by the Mind, by examining the moſt Natural Relations which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parts and Motions of Extenſion.</p>
                        <p>If we would examine the Nature of Bodies here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, we muſt firſt conſider, that whereas the firſt Element being compounded of an infinite Number of different Figures, the Bodies which have been formed out of the Congeries of the Parts of this Element would be manifold. Some of their Parts would be branched, others long, and others round, but irregular in every reſpect. If their branched Parts are groſs enough, they would be hard, but flexible, and inelaſtick, like Gold: If their Parts are leſs groſs, they would be ſoft and fluid, like Gums, Fat, or Oyles: But if their branched Parts are extreamly delicate, they will be like Air. If the long Parts of Bodies are groſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, they will be ſharp, incorruptible, eaſie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve like Salt: If theſe ſame long Parts are flexible, they will be inſipid like Water: If they have groſs and irregular <hi>Parts</hi> in every reſpect, they will be like Earth and Stones. In ſhort, we ſhall have Bodies of many different Natures, and not two of them that will intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be alike; becauſe the firſt Element is capable of an infinite Number of Figures, and all theſe Figures ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver combine after the ſame manner in two different Bodies. Whatever Figures theſe Bodies have, if they have Pores great enough to permit the ſecond Element to paſs through, they will be tranſparent, like Air,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107782:100"/>Water, and Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whatever Figures theſe Bodies are endued with, if the firſt Element intirely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds ſome Parts of them, and agitates them ſtrongly, and ſwift enough to repulſe the ſecond Element on all Sides, they will be Luminous like Flame. If theſe Bodies repulſe all the ſecond Element which ſhocks them, they will be very white; if they receive it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Oppoſition, they will be very black: In ſhort, if they repulſe it by divers Shocks or Vibrations, they will appear of different Colours.</p>
                        <p>As to their different Situation, the heavieſt that is, thoſe that have the leaſt Power to continue their Motion in a right Line, will be neareſt the Center, as Metals; Earth, Air, Water, will be more diſtant from it, and all Bodies would keep the Situation we ſee them in, becauſe they ought to be placed ſo much the more diſtant from the Center of the Earth, as their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is greater</p>
                        <p>And we muſt not be ſurprized, if I now ſay, that Metals have leſs tower to continue their Motion in a right tine than the Earth, Water, and other Bodies leſs ſolid; although I have before ſaid, that the moſt ſolid Bodies have more Power to continue their Motion in a right Line than others. For the Reaſon why Metals have leſs Power to continue to move, than the Earth or Stones, is becauſe they have much leſs Motion: Since it is always true, that two Bodies, unequal in Solidity, being moved with an equal Swiftneſs, the moſt ſolid has the moſt Power to keep in a right Line, becauſe then the moſt ſolid has the moſt Motion, and 'tis the Motion that gives the Power.</p>
                        <p>If, we would know the Reaſon why near the Center of the Vortices, groſs Bodies are heavy, and yet are light when they are more diſtant from it; we muſt conſider, that great Bodies receive their Motion from the ſubtle Matter which environs them, and in which they ſwim. Now, this ſubtle Matter actually moves in a Circular Line, and only inclinesto move in a right Line, and communicates this Circular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the groſs Bodies which it carries along with it, without communicating to them its Efforts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107782:101"/>from the Center by a right Line, only ſo much as this Effort is followed by the Motion it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates to them: For we muſt obſerve, that the Parts of the ſubtle Matter, making an Effort towards diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sides, can only compreſs the groſs Bodies they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry along with them: For this Body cannot go to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sides at the ſame Time. But becauſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Matter which is near the Center of the Vortex, hath much more Motion than it imployes in the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and communicates to the groſs Bodies it draws after it, only its Circular Motion, which is common to all its Parts: And if groſs Bodies ſhould chance to have more Motion than that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Vortix, they would ſoon loſe it, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it to the little Bodies they meet: From when it is plain, that groſs Bodies, near the Center of the Vortex, have not ſo much Motion as the Matter in which they ſwim; each Part of which is moved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many different Ways, beſides their circular or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Motion. Now if groſs Bodies have leſs Motion, they certainly make a weaker Effort to paſs into a right Line; and if they make leſs Efforts, they are obliged to give way to thoſe that make more, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to approach nearer to the Center of the Vortex, that is, they are ſo much the more weighty as they are the more ſolid.</p>
                        <p>But where groſs Bodies are far diſtant from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Vortix, the Circular Motion of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Matter is then very great, becauſe it imploys al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all its Motion in turning about the Center of the Vortix; as Bodies have ſo much the more Motion as they have more Solidity, ſince they go with the ſame Swiftneſs as the ſubtle Matter they ſwim in, and have more Power to continue their Motion in a right Line; ſo that groſs Bodies, in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Center of the Vortex, are ſo much the lighter as they are more ſolid.</p>
                        <p>This agreed, we may conſider that the Earth is more Metallick towards the Center; that it is not very Solid hear its Circumference: That Water and Air muſt continue in the ſame Situation we ſee them
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107782:101"/>in: But that all theſe Bodies are heavy<note n="*" place="margin">That is, they are impelled towards the Center of the Earth.</note>, the Air is heavy as well as Gold and Quick-ſilver, becauſe they are more Solid and more Groſs than the firſt and ſecond Element. This granted, the Moon being a little too diſtant from the Center of the Vortex of the Earth is not heavy although it be ſolid: That <hi>Mercury Venus,</hi> the Earth, <hi>Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> cannot fall into the Sun, and that they are not ſolid enough to go out of this Vortex like Comets, that they are in Equilibrio, with the Matter they ſwim in, and that if we could ſhoot a Musket or Cannon-bullet high enough, theſe two Bodies would become little Planets, or like little Comets which could no longer continue in Vortices, having a compleat Solidity.</p>
                        <p>I do not pretend to have ſufficiently explain'd what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have ſaid, or to have deduced from the Simple Principles of Extenſion, Figure, and Motion, all that might be inferred; I would only ſhow the manner <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has taken to diſcover Natural things, that we may compare his Idea's and Method with that of other Philoſophers. I had here no other deſign: But I am not afraid to affirm, that if we would ceaſe to admire the Virtue of the Loadſtone, the regulated Motions of the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, the Noiſe of Thunder, and Generation of Meteors, In ſhort, If we would inſtruct our ſelves in the Foundation of Phyſicks, there is no better way to do it, than by Reading and Meditating on his Works; ſo we can make nothing of it if we follow not his Method, I mean, if we do not, like him, argue from clear Idea's, beginning always with the moſt Simple.</p>
                        <p>'Tis not that this Author is Infallible, nay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my ſelf able to demonſtrate that he is miſtaken in many places of his Works: But 'tis more Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to thoſe that read him, to believe that he is ſometimes deceived, than if they were perſwaded whatever he ſays was true. If we believed him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, we ſhould read him without examining, we ſhould believe what he ſaid without knowing it, we ſhould learn his Sentiments as we do Hiſtories, and ſhould not inform our Minds by it. He himſelf tells
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107782:102"/>us, that when we read his Works, we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire if he is not deceived, and muſt believe nothing he ſays, except Evidence compels us to it. For he is not like to thoſe falſly Learned Men, who uſurp an unjuſt Dominion over the Minds of others, requiring to be believed upon their word; and who inſtead of making Men Diſciples of Internal Truth, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing only clear Idea's to them, endeavour to ſubmit them to the Authority of the Heathens, and by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they underſtand not, make them receive Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions they cannot comprehend.</p>
                        <p>The chief thing we have to ſay againſt <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s manner of producing the Sun, Stars, and the Earth, and all Bodies which are about us, is becauſe it appears contrary to what the Holy Scripture tells us of the Creation of the World: And if we believe this Author, it ſeems that the Univerſe was form'd from it ſelf, ſuch as we ſee it at this day: To which many Anſwers may be given.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Thoſe who ſay <hi>Deſcartes</hi> is contrary to <hi>Moſes,</hi> it may be have not ſo much examined both the Holy Bible and <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> as thoſe who have ſhown by their publick Writings, that the Creation of the World perfectly agrees with the Opinions of this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</p>
                        <p>But the beſt Anſwer is, <hi>Deſcartes</hi> never pretended things were made juſt as he deſcribed them; for in the firſt Article of the fourth Part of his <hi>Principles,</hi> which is, <hi>That to find the true Cauſes of whatever is upon Earth, we muſt keep the Hypotheſis already received, notwithſtanding it ſhould be falſe.</hi> He poſitiveſy ſays the contrary in theſe Terms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Although I require not a Belief, that Bodies which compoſe this viſible World, were ever produced in the ſame manner I have deſcribed them, (as I before inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) I am nevertheleſs oblige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to keep here the ſame Hypotheſis to explain whatever is upon the Earth; for if I evidently ſhew, as I hope to do, by this means, the moſt intelligible and certain reaſons for whatever we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in it; and that it cannot he done by any other Method: I may thence reaſonably conclude, That although
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107782:102"/>the World was not made after this manner in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but immediately created by God, all things that it contains, ceaſe not to be now of the ſame Nature, as if they had been ſo produced.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Deſcartes</hi> knew, that to apprehend things well, they muſt be conſidered in their Original: That we muſt always begin with the moſt Simple things: That we muſt not perplex our ſelves whether God had formed his Works by degrees, or after the moſt ſimple ways, or if he had produced them all at once: But however God had made them, to know them well, we muſt firſt conſider them in their Principles, and only take care of the Conſequence, and then ſee how our Thought might agree with what God hath done. He knew that the Laws of Nature, by which God preſerved all his Works in the Order and Situation they now are, are the ſame Laws as thoſe by which he formed and diſpoſed them: For 'tis plain to all that conſider things attentively, that if God had made his whole Work all at once, in the ſame Diſpoſition he has placed it in time; the whole Order of Nature would have been overturned, ſince the Laws of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation would have been contrary to thoſe of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If all the Univerſe continues in the order we ſee it, 'tis becauſe the Laws of Motion which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in this order, were capable of producing it. And if God had placed it in a different order from that it was put in by the Laws of Motion, all things would be overturned, and by the Force of thoſe Laws be placed in the ſame order we ſee them now.</p>
                        <p>If a Man would diſcover the Nature of a Chicken, he ought every day to open ſome of the Eggs that the Hen ſits on, and examine what grows and moves firſt: He ſoon would diſcover that the Heart begins to beat, and on all ſides to force out little Chanels of Blood which are Arteries; that this Blood returns to the Heart by Veins, that the Brain alſo ſoon appears, and that the Bones are the laſt parts which are formed. By this means he delivers himſelf from many Errors, and from theſe Obſervations draws many Conſequences
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107782:103"/>of great uſe in diſcovering the Nature of Animals. Who can ſay any thing againſt the Conduct of this Man? Can it be ſaid, that he pretends that God made the firſt Chicken immediately from an Egg, and by giving it a certain degree of Heat cauſed it to be hatch'd; becauſe he endeavours to diſcover the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chickens in their Formation?</p>
                        <p>Why then is <hi>Deſcartes</hi> accuſed of ſpeaking contrary to the Scripture, becauſe intending to examine the Nature of viſible things, he examines the Formation of them by the Laws of Motion in all their Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences? He never doubted,<note n="*" place="margin">Art. <hi>45.</hi> of the third Part of his Principles.</note> 
                           <hi>But the World was in the Beginning created in its utmoſt Perfection, ſo that the Sun, the Moon, and Stars, were from the Beginning; and that the Earth had not only in it ſelf the Seeds of Plants, but that even Plants themſelves covered a part of it: That</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>were not created in Infancy, but at perfect Age. The Chriſtian Religion,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will have us believe this, and Natural Reaſon abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us of this Truth, becauſe conſidering the Almighty Power of God, we muſt judge, that whatever he has made, has its utmoſt Perfection in it. But as we ſhould much better diſcover the Nature of</hi> Adam, <hi>and that of the Trees of Paradiſe, if we examined how Children were by degrees formed, in the Womb, and how Plants ſprung up from their Seeds; then if we only conſidered them as they were after God had created them, ſo we ſhould better underſtand what is generally the Nature of all things in the World, if we could imagine ſome Principles which are very Intelligible and Simple; from which we might clearly ſee, that the Stars, the Earth, and in ſhort, all the viſible World, might have been thus produced as from ſome Seeds, although we know they were not produced in this manner; than if we deſcribe it only as it is, or as we believe it was created: And becauſe I think I have found ſuch Principles, I will endeavour to explain them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>M. <hi>Deſcartes</hi> thought that God made the World in an inſtant, but alſo believed he had created it in the ſame Order and Diſpoſition of parts as it would have been in, if he had formed it by little and little after the moſt ſimple way. And this Thought is worthy the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107782:103"/>Power and Wiſdom of God: His Power, ſince in a Moment he has created all his Works in their greateſt Perfection: Of his Wiſdom, ſince by that he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered he perfectly foreſaw all that would neceſſarily happen in Matter, if it was acted by the moſt ſimple ways: And alſo becauſe the Order of Nature could not ſubſiſt, if the World had been made contrary to the Laws of Motion by which it is preſerved.</p>
                        <p>It is Ridiculous to ſay M. <hi>Deſcartes</hi> believed the World was form'd of it ſelf, ſince he acknowledges, as all thoſe do who follow the Light of Reaſon, that no Body can move it ſelf; and that all the immutable Laws of the Communication of Motion, are only the Conſequences of the unchangeable Will of God, who continually acts after the ſame manner. Having proved there is but one God who gives Motion to Matter, and that Motion produces in all Bodies, all the different Forms we ſee them cloathed with, it was ſufficient to take away from Libertines all their pretext of drawing any Advantage from his Syſtem. On the contrary, If the Atheiſts made any Reflection upon the Principles of this Philoſophy, they would ſoon find themſelves conſtrained to acknowledge their Errors. For if, like the Heathens, they would affirm, that Matter was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, they could not alſo, maintain, that it would ever have been able to have moved of it ſelf. So that the Atheiſts would at leaſt be obliged to confeſs the true Mover, if they denied the true Creator. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Philoſophy furniſhes them with Methods to blind themſelves and maintain their Errors; for it tells them of certain impreſſed Vertues, and moving Faculties. In ſhort, of a certain Nature which is the Principle of Motion in every thing, and although they have no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Idea of it, they are very glad, becauſe of the Corruption of their Hearts, to put it in the place of the true God, by concluding it is that which produces all the Wonders we ſee.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> An Explanation of the Principles of the Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Philoſophy, wherein it appears he never obſerved the Second Part of the General Rule. With an Examination of his Elementary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</head>
                        <p>THAT we may make ſome Compariſon between the Philoſophy of <hi>Deſcartes</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it will be proper to give a little Abridgment of what he thought of his Elements, and of the Nature of Bodies in General, which the moſt Learned believe he has ſhewn in his four Books <hi>de Caelo;</hi> for his eight Books of Phyſicks belongs rather to Logick, or if you will, to Metaphyſicks than to Phyſicks, ſince they are only compoſed of rambling and general words, which repreſent nothing diſtinct and particular to the Mind. Theſe four Books are entitled <hi>de Caelo,</hi> becauſe the Heavens are the chief amongſt the ſimple Bodies he treats of.</p>
                        <p>This Philoſopher begins his Work with proving the World is perfect, and this is his Argument for it. All Bodies have three Dimenſions, they cannot have more, for according to the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> the number Three comprehends every thing: Now the World is a Collection of all Bodies, therefore the World is perfect: By this pleaſant proof we might alſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that the World cannot be more Imperfect than it is, ſince it cannot be compoſed of parts which have leſs than three Dimenſions.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Chapter he immediately ſuppoſes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Peripatetical Truths: 1. That all Natural Bodies have the power of Motion in themſelves, which he neither proves here nor elſewhere. On the contrary, in the firſt Chapter of his ſecond Book of Phyſicks he affirms, That 'tis Ridiculous to endeavour to prove it: Becauſe, ſays he, it is ſelf-evident, and 'tis only
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107782:104"/>ſuch as cannot diſcern what is known of it ſelf, or what is not ſo, who endeavour to prove that which is evident, by that which is obſcure. But we have already ſhewn that 'tis abſolutely falſe, that Natural Bodies have in themſelves the power of moving; and that it appears evident only to ſuch Perſons, who with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> follow the Impreſſion of their, Senſes, and make no uſe of their Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>He ſays in the ſecond place, That all Local Motion is made in a right or circular Line, or compoſed of both: But if he would not conſider of what he ſo boldly advances, he ought at leaſt to open his Eyes, and then he would ſoon have ſeen an infinite number of Motions, which are neither compounded of a right nor circular Line. Or rather he ſhould have thought, that the Motions compounded of Motions in a right Line, might have been infinitely different, if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that compounded Motions increaſe or diminiſh their Swiftneſs in an infinite number of different ways, as is evident from what has been ſaid before. There are, ſays he, only theſe two ſimple Motions, the Right, and the Circular, of which all Motions are compoſed. But he is deceived, the Circular Motion is not Simple we cannot conceive it without thinking of one point to which it relates; and whatever includes a Relation, is Relative and not Simple. It is true, we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Circular Motion, as produced by two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a right Line, the Swiftneſs of which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal according to a certain Proportion; for a Motion compounded of two others which are made in a right Line, and which diverſly increaſe or diminiſh their Swiftneſs, cannot be Simple.</p>
                        <p>In the third place he ſays, all ſimple Motions are of three ſorts, one from the Center, another to the Center, and the third about the Center. But it is falſe, the laſt is Simple, as I have already ſaid: 'Tis alſo falſe that there is no ſimple Motions but thoſe that aſcend and deſcend; for all Motions in a right Line are Simple, whether they approach to or remove from the Center, the Poles, or any other Point. All Bodies, ſays he, are compoſed of three Dimenſions.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107782:105"/>Therefore all Bodies ought to have three Simple Motions. What relation is there between theſe, Simple Motions and Dimenſions? Nay more, all Bodies have three Dimenſions, but no Bodies three Simple Motions.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth place, he ſuppoſes that Bodies are either Simple or Compounded; and he ſays, Simple Bodies are ſuch as have in themſelves ſome Power of Motion, as Fire, Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the compounded ones receive their Motion from thoſe which compoſe them. But in this Senſe there is no Simple Bodies at all, for there are none which have in themſelves any Principle of their Motion. Nor is there any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Bodies, ſince Compounded ſuppoſe Simple, which are not; thus we ſhould have no Bodies at all. What Imagination can we have of defining the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Bodies by a Power of moving themſelves? What diſtinct Idea's are united to theſe words of Simple and Compound Bodies, if Simple Bodies are only defined by their relation to an Imaginary Power of moving themſelves? But let us examine the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences he draws from theſe Principles. Circular Motion is a Simple Motion: The Heavens move cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly; therefore this Motion is Simple. Now Simple Motion can proceed only from a Simple Body, that is, from a Body which moves by its own Power: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heavens are a Simple Body diſtinct from the four Elements which move by right Lines. It is very evident, that all this arguing contains only falſe and abſurd Propoſitions. Let us examine his other Proofs, for he brings a great many to prove a thing as uſeleſs as it is falſe.</p>
                        <p>His ſecond reaſon to prove that the Heavens are a Simple Body, diſtinct from the four Elements, ſuppoſes two ſorts of Motions, the one <hi>Natural,</hi> and the other <hi>Violent</hi> or againſt Nature. But it is plain enough to all thoſe who judge of things by clear Idea's, That Bodies having not in themſelves the Nature or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of their Motion, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> underſtood, there can be no violent Motion, or ſuch as is contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is indifferent to all Bodies, whether they are
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107782:105"/>moved or not; moved on one ſide or moved on the other. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> who judges of things by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his Senſes, imagines that Bodies which are always placed by the Laws of the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Motion in ſuch or ſuch a Situation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to others, are placed there of themſelves, becauſe they like it beſt, and that it is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their Nature. This is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s way of arguing.</p>
                        <p>The Circular Motion of the Heavens is Natural, or elſe contrary to Nature: If it is Natural, as we have ſaid, it is a Simple Body diſtinct from the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſince the Elements move not circularly by their Natural Motion. If the Circular Motion is againſt the Nature of the Heavens, the Heavens would be compoſed of ſome one of the Elements, as Fire, or ſome other thing. But the Heavens can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compoſed of any of the Elements, for, if for inſtance it was Fire, the natural Motion of Fire being to aſcend, the Firmament would have two contrary Motions, the Circular, and the aſcending one; which could not be, ſince a Body cannot have two contrary Motions. If the Firmament was compoſed of ſome other Body, which by its Nature did not move circularly, it would have ſome other Natural Motion which cannot be; for if naturally it aſcended, it muſt be either Fire or Air; if it deſcended, it would be Earth or Water: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall not ſtop here, to make particular Remarks of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of theſe Arguments: I only ſay in general, that what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> here ſays ſignifies nothing diſtinct, and that there is nothing of Truth or Concluſion in it. His third Reaſon is as follows.</p>
                        <p>The firſt and moſt perfect of all Simple Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, muſt be the Motion of a Simple Body, and even of the firſt and moſt perfect of Simple Bodies. But the Circular Motion is the firſt and moſt perfect of all Simple Motions, becauſe all Circular Lines are perfect, and no right Line is ſo. For if it is Finite, we may add ſomething to it; if Infinite, it is not yet perfect, ſince it has no

                           <hi>End,</hi> and things are perfect only when they are <hi>finiſhed;</hi> therefore Circular Motion is the firſt and moſt perfect of all Motion: Therefore Bodies which more circularly are Simple, and the firſt and moſt Divine of Simple Bodies. His fourth Argument.</p>
                        <p>All Motion is either Natural or not ſo, and all Motion that is Unnatural to one Body, is Natural to ſome other: We ſee that Motions that deſcend and aſcend, which are Unnatural to ſome Bodies, yet are. Natural to others: For Fire deſcends not Naturally, but the Earth does. Now the Circular Motion is not Natural to any of the four Elements: There muſt be then a Simple Body to which this Motion is Natural therefore the Heavens which are moved circularly, are a Simple Body differing from the four Elements.</p>
                        <p>In fine, The Circular Motion is Natural or <hi>Violent</hi> in ſome Body: If it be Natural, it is evident that Body muſt be the moſt Simple and Perfect: If it is not Natural, it is very ſtrange that this Motion ſhould continue always, ſince we ſee all unnatural Motions endure but a little time. We muſt therefore, after all theſe Reaſons, believe, that there is ſome other Body ſeparate from all thoſe which ſurround us, which is, of a Nature ſo much the more perfect as it is more diſtant from us. Here is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Reaſons; but I deſie the moſt Intelligent of his Interpreters to joyn diſtinct Idea's to the Terms which he makes uſe of; and to prove that this Philoſopher began with the moſt Simple things, before he ſpoke of the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; which is abſolutely neceſſary to reaſon well, as I have before proved.</p>
                        <p>If I was not afraid of being tireſome, I would yet tranſlate ſome Chapters of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> But beſides, our taking little Pleaſure to read them in our own Tongue (when we clearly underſtand what he means) I have ſufficiently ſhewn by the little I have related, that his Manner of Philoſophizing, is wholly uſeleſs for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Truth. For ſince he ſays himſelf, in the Fifth Chapter of this Book, that thoſe that deceive themſelves in any thing at firſt, deceive themſelves a Thouſand times more if they advance far. It is plain;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107782:106"/>that if he knew not what he ſaid in the two firſt Chapters of his Book; we may reaſonably believe, that it is not ſafe to take things upon his Authority, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining his Reaſons. But to be better perſwaded of it, I will make it appear, that there is not one Chapter in this Book wherein there is not ſome Abſurdity.</p>
                        <p>In the third Chapter he ſays, the Heavens are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and not ſubject to Alteration, he brings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very fooliſh Arguments to prove this, becauſe, for Example, there is the Habitation of the Immortal Gods, and becauſe there was never any Change obſerved in them: This laſt Reaſon might be admitted, if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could have proved that any one had come from thence, or had lived near enough to theſe celeſtial Bodies, to make accurate Obſervations of them. But however, I don't know who would believe ſuch an Authority, ſince Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcopes do ſhew us the contrary.</p>
                        <p>He pretends, in the Fourth Chapter, to prove, that there are no contrary Circular Motions. Yet it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Motion from Eaſt to Weſt, is contrary to that from Weſt to Eaſt.</p>
                        <p>In the Fifth Chapter he improperly proves, that Bodies are not infinite; drawing his Proofs from the Motion of ſimple Bodies: For What hinders but that there may be above his <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> ſome immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Extenſion?</p>
                        <p>In the Sixth he uſeleſly amuſes himſelf to prove, that the Elements are not infinite. For who can doubt of it, when we ſuppoſe with him, that they are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Heavens which ſurrounds them? But he makes himſelf ridiculous, when he endeavours to prove it by their Weight and Lightneſs. If the Elements were infinite, ſays he, they would have an infinite Weight, and an infinite Lightneſs, which cannot be. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thoſe that would ſee his Arguments at large, may read them in his Books: I think it Loſs of Time to relate them.</p>
                        <p>In the Seventh he continues to prove, that Bodies are not infinite, and his firſt Proof ſuppoſes it neceſſary for all Bodies to be in Motion; which he does not prove, nor indeed can it be proved.</p>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:107782:107"/>
                        <p>He maintains, in the Eighth, that there are not many Worlds of the ſame Kind, by this pleaſant Argument. If there was another Earth, like this we inhabit, the Earth being heavy by Nature, it would fall upon ours, becauſe ours is the Center to which all heavy Bodies ought to tend. From whence has he learned this, but from his Senſes?</p>
                        <p>In the Ninth he proves, that 'tis even impoſſible there ſhould be a Plurality of Worlds; becauſe, if there was any Body above the Heavens, it would be ſimple or compound, in a Natural or Violent State, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be from the Reaſons he has drawn from his three Kinds of Motion, which I have already ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>He affirms, in the Tenth, that the World is Eternal, becauſe he cannot prove that it had a Beginning, and that it will always endure; ſince we ſee whatſoever is created corrupts in Time. This he has likewiſe learnt from his Senſes. But who has taught him, that the World ſhall always endure?</p>
                        <p>He imploys the Eleventh Chapter in explaining what we mean by incorruptible, as if the Equivocation was much to be feared, and that a great Uſe ought to be made of its Explanation. Yet, this Term Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is ſo clear of it ſelf, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does not give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Trouble to explain, neither in what Senſe it ought to be taken, nor how he underſtood it himſelf: It would have been more to the Purpoſe if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined an infinite Number of Terms he makes uſe of, which ſtir up only ſenſible Idea's: For we might then, it may be, have learned ſomething by reading his Works.</p>
                        <p>And in the laſt Chapter of the firſt Book of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, he eſſays to prove, that the World is incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and will eternally endure, becauſe he cannot prove it had a Beginning. All things, ſays he, ſubſiſt for a finite or infinite Time. But what is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite only in one Senſe, is neither finite nor infinite. Therefore nothing can ſubſiſt after this manner.</p>
                        <p>This is the way of reaſoning, us'd by the <hi>Prince</hi> of Philoſophers, that <hi>Genius</hi> of Nature; who in ſtead of diſcovering die true Cauſe of Natural Effects
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107782:107"/>by clear and diſtinct Idea's, has eſtabliſhed a Heathen Philoſophy upon the falſe and confuſed Idea's of the Senſes; or upon ſuch as are too general to be of any Uſe in an Enquiry after Truth.</p>
                        <p>I do not here find Fault with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> becauſe he did not know that God created the World in Time, to make known his Power, and the Dependance of his Creatures; and that he will never deſtroy it, that we may know alſo that he is immutable, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents of his Deſigns. But I believe my ſelf able to confute his weak Proofs of the Worlds Eternity. Though he ſometimes is excuſable in the Opinions he maintains; yet he is hardly ever ſo in the Reaſons he brings, when he treats on Subjects which include any Difficulty. We are, it may be, already perſwaded of it by what I have ſaid, although I have not related all the Errors I have met with in the Book I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and I have endeavoured to make him ſpeak more clearly than he was accuſtomed to do.</p>
                        <p>But that we may be fully convinced, that the <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of Nature</hi> hath never diſcovered either the Secrets or Springs of it: It will be proper for me to ſhew, that the Principles this Philoſopher makes uſe of to explain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effects, have no Reaſon in them.</p>
                        <p>It is plain, that we can diſcover nothing in Phyſicks, if we begin not with the moſt ſimple Bodies, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; For the Elements are the Bodies into which all others reſolve, becauſe they are contained in them either actually or<note n="*" place="margin">I ſpeak according to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks, <hi>c. 3. l. 3.</hi> de Coelo.</note> Potentially, ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines them. But we cannot find in the Works of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that he has, by a diſtinct Idea, explained theſe ſimple Bodies, into which he pretends the others reſolve: And conſequently, his Elements not being clearly known, it is impoſſible to diſcover the Nature of the Bodies which are compoſed of them.</p>
                        <p>This Philoſopher ſays true, that there are four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. But he does not clearly know the Nature of them: He gives no diſtinct Idea of them: Nay, he will not have his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be compoſed of the Fire, Air, Water, and Earth that we ſee; for in ſhort, if it were ſo, we
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107782:108"/>ſhould at leaſt have ſome Knowledge of them by our Senſes. It is true, in many Places of his Works, he endeavours to explain them, by the Qualities of Heat and Cold, Humidity and Drineſs, Weight and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But this manner of Explication is ſo impertinent and ridiculous, that I cannot conceive how ſo many learned Men ſhould be ſatisfied with it. 'Tis what I am going to prove.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his Book of the Heavens, pretends that the Earth is the Center of the World, and that all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which he pleaſes to call ſimple, becauſe he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them to move by their own Nature, muſt be moved by ſimple Motions. He affirms, that beſides the Circular Motion, which he maintains to be ſimple, and by which he proves, that the Heavens he ſuppoſes to move Circularly, are a ſimple Body, that there is only two which are ſimple: The one deſcending, or from the Circumference to the Center, the other aſcending, or from the Center to the Circumference: That theſe ſimple Motions agree with ſimple Bodies; conſequently, that the Earth and Fire are ſimple Bodies, one of which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely heavy, and the other abſolutely light: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Heavineſs and Lightneſs may meet in one Body, either abſolutely, or in part, he concludes, that there are alſo two Elements or ſimple Bodies, one of which is heavy in part, and the other light in part, <hi>viz.</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Air. This is the Method he takes, to prove, that there are four Elements, and no more.</p>
                        <p>It is evident to ſuch as examine Mens Opinions by their own Reaſon, that all theſe Propoſitions are falſe, or at leaſt, they can never paſs for clear and indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principles, of which we have very clear and diſtinct Idea's, and which may ſerve for the Foundations of Phyſicks. It is certain, that there is nothing more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than an Eſſay to eſtabliſh the Number of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by Imaginary Qualities of Weight and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: In ſaying without any Proof, that there are ſome Bodies which are heavy, others light, through a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in their own Nature. For if we may ſpeak without proving what we ſay, we may affirm, that all Bodies are naturally heavy, and that all endeavour
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:107782:108"/>to approach to the Center of the World, as the Place of their Reſt: And we may on the contrary maintain, that all Bodies are Naturally light, and have a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the Heavens, as the Place of their greateſt Perfection: For if we object to him, who ſays, all Bodies are heavy, that Air and Fire are light, he can only anſwer, that Fire and Air are not light, but only leſs weighty than Earth and Water, and that is the Reaſon they ſeem light. It is ſo with theſe Elements, as if a Piece of Wood, which ſeems light in Water, not becauſe it is light of it ſelf, ſince it falls down when it is in the Air, but becauſe the Water, which is more heavy, makes it aſcend and bears it up.</p>
                        <p>If, on the contrary, we ſhould object to one who would maintain, that all Bodies are Naturally light, that Earth and Water are heavy, he would likwiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that theſe Bodies ſeem heavy becauſe they are not ſo light as others which ſurround them. That Wood, for inſtance, ſeems heavy in the Air, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is heavy, ſince it ſwims when it is in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but becauſe it is not ſo light as Air.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore ridiculous to ſuppoſe theſe Principles indiſputable, that Bodies are heavy or light in their own Nature. On the contrary, 'tis plain, that all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have not the Power of Motion in themſelves; and that 'tis indifferent to them whether they are moved upward or downward, Eaſt or Weſt, North or South, or any other Way we can conceive.</p>
                        <p>But if, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> there are four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch as he wiſhes them to be; Two Naturally heavy, and two Naturally light, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Air, Earth, and Water. What Conſequence can we draw from thence, to diſcover the Knowledge of the Univerſe? Theſe Four Elements are not ſuch Fire, Air, Water, and Earth as we ſee, they are quite different; we know them not by our Senſes, and ſtill leſs by Reaſon, becauſe we have no diſtinct Idea of them. I mean, we know all Natural Bodies are compoſed of them, ſince <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> has ſaid it. But the Nature of theſe compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bodies is unknown to us, and we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, but by knowing the Four Elements or
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107782:109"/>ſimple Bodies which compoſe them, for we know the compound only by the ſimple.</p>
                        <p>Fire, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, is Naturally light; the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Motion is ſimple: Therefore Fire is a ſimple Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſince Motion muſt be proportioned to what it moves. Natural Bodies are compounded of ſimple Bodies: Therefore there is Fire in all Natural Bodies. But a Fire which is not like to that we ſee; for Fire is often only in <hi>Power</hi> in Bodies which are compounded of it. What is it theſe Periparetick Diſcourſes teach us? That there is Fire in all Bodies either <hi>Actual</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential;</hi> that all Bodies are compoſed of ſomething which we do not ſee, and whoſe Nature we are unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. We ſee then that here is very much advanced.</p>
                        <p>But if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does not diſcover to us the Nature of Fire, and the other Elements of which all Bodies are compoſed, probably we may imagine he has diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at leaſt the chief Qualities and Properties of them. We ſhall further examine what he ſays thereof.</p>
                        <p>He declares to us, there are four principal Qualities which belong to the Senſe of feeling,<note place="margin">l. 2. c. 2, 3. <hi>de gen. &amp; corrupu.</hi>
                           </note> Heat, Cold, Moiſt, and dry, of which all others are compoſed: In this manner he diſtributes theſe firſt Qualities to the Four Elements. To the Fire he gives Heat and Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to the Air Heat and Moiſtneſs; to the Water Coldneſs and Humidity; and to the Earth Coldneſs and Dryneſs.<note place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> He affirms Heat and Cold to be active Qualities, and Dryneſs and Humidity to be paſſive ones. He thus defines Heat, <hi>That what collects things of the ſame kind:</hi> Cold, <hi>which aſſembles all things, either of the ſame or of a different kind:</hi> Moiſture, <hi>that which is not eaſily contained in its own Bounds, but in Foreign Limits:</hi> and Dryneſs, <hi>that which is eaſily contained in its own Bounds, and not eaſily in the Limits of the Bodies that are about it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> Fire is a hot and dry Element: 'Tis therefore an Element which collects things of the ſame Nature, which is eaſily contained within its own Limits, and difficultly in the Limits of Forreign Bodies. The Air is an hot and moiſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore aſſembles things of the ſame kind, and is not eaſily contained in its own Limits, but in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107782:109"/>that of others. Water is a cold and moiſt Element, which gathers things together, both of the ſame and of a different Nature, which is hot eaſily contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its own Bounds, but in that of others. And in fine, the Earth, cold and dry; and therefore collects things of the ſame and of a different Nature, which is not eaſily contained in its own Bounds, and very difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that of others.</p>
                        <p>Here the Elements are explained according to the Sentiment of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or according to the Definitions he has given of their chief Qualities; and becauſe, if we will believe him, the Elements are ſimple Bodies, whereof all others are compounded; the Knowledge of theſe Element and their Qualities muſt be moſt clear and diſtinct, ſince all Phyſicks, or the Knowledge of Senſible Bodies which are compoſed of them, ought to be deduced from thence.</p>
                        <p>Let us ſee then what is defective in theſe Principles: Firſt, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> joyns no diſtinct Idea to the Word <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> We know not whether by Quality he means a real Being diſtinct from Matter, or only the Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matter: It ſeems ſometimes as if he meant it in one Senſe, and ſometimes in another. It is true, in the Eighth Chapter of <hi>Categories,</hi> he defines Quality to be that which cauſes a thing to have ſuch or ſuch a Name, but that will not ſatisfie our Demands. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Definitions he gives of his four firſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Heat, Cold, Moiſt, and Dry, are all falſe or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. This is his Definition of Heat, <hi>Heat is that which aſſembles things of a like Nature,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, we do not ſee that this Definition perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the Nature of Heat, although it ſhould be true, that Heat collects all things of the ſame Nature.</p>
                        <p>But ſecondly, it is falſe, for Heat does not collect all things of the ſame Nature. Heat does not aſſemble the Parts of Water, it rather diſſipates them into a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour. Nor does it aſſemble the Particles of Wine, or thoſe of all other Liquors, or fluid Bodies whatever: Nor even, thoſe of Quickſilver. On the contrary, it reſolves and ſeparates all ſolid Bodies, and even Fluids, although of a different Nature. And if there are any
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107782:110"/>whoſe Parts Fire cannot diſſipate, 'tis not becauſe they are of the ſame Nature, but becauſe ſome are too groſs and too ſolid to be raiſed by the Motion of the Parts of Fire.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, Heat indeed can neither aſſemble nor diſſipate the Parts of any Body whether Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous or Heterogeneous. For to aſſemble, to ſeparate, or diſſipate the Parts of any Body, it muſt move them: Now Heat can move nothing; or at leaſt, 'tis not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Heat can move Bodies: For although we conſider Heat with all the Attention poſſible, we can only diſcover that it may communicate to Bodies a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it has not in it ſelf. Yet we ſee that Fire moves and ſeparates the Parts of Bodies that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it: It is true, but it may be, it is not from its Heat, for even it is not evident that it has any at all. 'Tis rather by the Action of its Parts, which are viſibly in a continual Motion. It is plain, that the Parts of Fire which ſtrike againſt any Body, muſt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a Part of their Motion to it, whether there is Heat in Fire or not. If the Parts of this Body are but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſolid and groſs, the Fire cannot move them, and make them ſlip one upon another: In ſhort, if they are a Mixture of ſubtle and groſs ones, the Fire can only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate thoſe that it can puſh ſtrong enough to ſeparate intirely from the reſt. Thus Fire can only ſeparate them; and if it aſſembles them, 'tis merely by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> pretends quite the contrary. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which ſome attribute to Fire, is only a reſembling of things of the ſame kind;</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>If <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had at firſt diſtinguiſhed the Sentiment of Heat from the Motion of the Particles, whereof the Bodies we call Heat are compoſed, and had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards defined Heat taken for the Motion of the Parts, by ſaying, Heat is that which agitates and ſeparates the inviſible Parts whereof viſible Bodies are compoſed, he would have given a tollerable Definition of Heat. Nevertheleſs, it would not perfectly have contented us, becauſe it would not preciſely have diſcovered to us the Nature of the Motion of hot Bodies.</p>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:107782:110"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines Coldneſs, <hi>to be that which aſſembles Bodies of the ſame, or of a different Nature.</hi> This Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is good for nothing: For 'tis falſe, that Cold aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles Bodies. To aſſemble them, it muſt move them, but if we conſult Reaſon, 'tis evident, Cold can move nothing. In Effect, by Cold he means, either what we feel when we are cold, or that which cauſes the Senſation of Cold. Now it is plain, that the Senſation of Cold can move nothing, ſince it can puſh nothing. What it is that cauſes Senſation, we cannot doubt when we examine things by our Reaſon, for 'tis only Reſt or a Ceſſation from Motion. So Cold in Bodies being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Ceſſation from this Sort of Motion which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Heat, it is evident that if Heat ſeparates, yet Cold does not. Thus Cold aſſembles neither things that are of a like or different Nature; for what can puſh nothing, can aſſemble nothing: In a Word, as it does nothing, it collects nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> judging of things by the Senſes, imagines Cold is alſo poſitive as well as Heat, becauſe the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Heat and Cold are both real and poſitive: And he alſo thinks that theſe two Qualities are active. And indeed, if we follow the Impreſſion of our Senſes, we have Reaſon to believe that Cold is a very active Quality, ſince cold Water congeals, reaſſembles, and in a Moment hardens melted Gold or Lead, after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is poured upon them, although the Heat of theſe Metals is great enough to ſeparate the Parts of any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they touch.</p>
                        <p>It is evident, by what we have ſaid of the Errors of the Senſes in the firſt Book, that if we rely only upon the Senſes, to judge of the Qualities of Senſible Bodies, it is impoſſible to diſcover any certain and undoubted Truth, which can ſerve as a Principle to aſſiſt us in the Knowledge of Nature. For by this Method only we cannot diſcover what things are hot, and what cold. For of many Perſons who ſhould touch Water that is luke-warm, ſome of them would think it hot, and others cold. Thoſe that are of a hot Conſtitution would think it cold, and thoſe that are of a cold would think it hot. And if we ſuppoſed Fiſh capable of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107782:111"/>'tis very probable they would think it hot, when all Men think it cold. It is the ſame with the Air, it ſeems hot or cold, according to the different Diſpoſitions of the Bodies that are expoſed to it. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> pretends 'tis hot, but I believe thoſe that dwell towards the North are of another Mind, ſince many learned Men, whoſe Climate is not colder than that of <hi>Greece,</hi> have maintained it to be cold. But this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which has always been conſiderable in the Schools, has never been ſufficiently reſolved to affix any diſtinct Idea to the Word Heat.</p>
                        <p>The Definitions <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives of the Words Heat and Cold, can fix no Idea to them. The Air, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and even Water, though never ſo hot and ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, reaſſembles the Parts of melted Lead, with thoſe of any other Metal whatever. Air collects all Fatneſs in Gums and other ſolid Bodies. And one muſt be a Peripatetick indeed to think of expoſing Maſtich to the Air, to ſeparate the Aſhes from the Pitch, or any other compounded Bodies, to diſſolve them again. The Air then is not hot according to the Definition <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives of Heat. Air ſeparates Liquors from Bodies which are imbibed in it, hardens Dirt, and dries Linnen that is extended in it, although <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes it moiſt: The Air therefore is hot and drying, according to this ſame Definition. We cannot then determine the Air to be hot or cold by this Definition. We may affirm, it is hot, in reſpect to Dirt, ſince it ſeparates the Water from the Earth that is mixed with it: But muſt we try all the divers Effects of Air upon all Bodies, to know whether or no there is Heat in the Air we breath. If ſo, we can never know any thing of it; the ſhorteſt Way therefore, is not to Philoſophize at all upon the Air we breath in. But upon a certain Pure and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Air which is not to be found here below, and poſitively affirm with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that 'tis hot, without giving any Proof of it, or even without knowing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly what we mean, by this Air or by this Heat; For this Way we ſhall give Principles that will not eaſily be overthrown, not becauſe of their Evidence and Solidity, but becauſe they are obſcure like Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107782:111"/>which cannot be hurt, becauſe they have no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not here ſtay upon the Definitions that <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> gives of Moiſture and Dryneſs, becauſe it is plain enough that he has not explained the Nature of them. For according to theſe Definitions, Fire is not dry, ſince it is not eaſily contained within its own Bounds, and Ice is not moiſt ſince it is contained within its own Bounds, and is not eaſily accommodated to the Limits of other Bodies. It is true, Ice is not <hi>moiſt,</hi> if by <hi>moiſt</hi> he means fluid: But if we underſtand it ſo, we may ſay Flame is very hot as well as melted Gold or Lead: It is likewiſe true, that Ice is not moiſt, if by <hi>moiſt</hi> we mean, that which eaſily ſticks to things that touch it; but in this Senſe, Pitch, Fat, and Oyl, are much more humid than Water, ſince they ſtick more ſtrongly than Water. In the ſame Senſe, Quickſilver is moiſt, for it ſticks to Metals; and even Water is not perfectly moiſt, for it cleaves not to the Generality of Metals. We muſt not then recur to the Teſtimony of the Senſes, to defend the Opinions of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But let us no further Examine the marvelous Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions that this Philoſopher has given us of the four Elementary Qualities; and let us ſuppoſe alſo, that all whatever the Senſes tell us of theſe Qualities is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable. Let us further excite our Faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all theſe Definitions are moſt juſt. Let us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee if it be true, that all Qualities of Senſible Bodies are compounded of theſe Elementary Qualities. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> pretends it, and he ought ſo to do, ſince he looks upon theſe four firſt Qualities as the Principles of thoſe things he would explain, in his Books of Phyſicks.</p>
                        <p>He teaches us then, that Colours are engendered of the Mixture of die four Elementary Qualities; that white is produced when Humidity ſurmounts Heat, as when Old Men turn Grey: Black, when Humidity is overcome by Dryneſs, as in the Walls of Ciſterns, and all other Colours by the like Mixtures; that Taſts and Smells are alſo produced by a different Mixture of <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>moiſt,</hi> cauſed by <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold:</hi> that even Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Heavineſs depend upon it. In a Word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107782:112"/>to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it is neceſſary, that all Senſible Qualities ſhould be produced by the two <hi>Active</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Heat and Cold, and be compounded of the two <hi>Paſſive,</hi> moiſt and dry, that there may be ſome probable Connection between his Principles, and the Conſequences he draws from them.</p>
                        <p>However, it is yet more difficult to perſwade our ſelves of all theſe things, than of all thoſe that we have hitherto related of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> We ſhall have ſome Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe that the Earth, and other Elements would not be coloured or viſible, if they were in their Natural Purity, and without any Mixture of Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Qualities, although the learned Commentators of this Philoſopher, aſſures us of it. We compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend not what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> means when he affirms the Whiteneſs of the Hair to be produced by Humidity, becauſe the Humidity of Old Men is ſtronger than their Heat; although to endeavour to clear him of the Thought, we put the Definition in the Place of the thing defined: For it ſeems to be an incomprehenſible Piece of Nonſence, to ſay the Hairs of Old Men turn White, becauſe that <hi>which is not eaſily contained in its own Limits, but in the Limits of other Bodies,</hi> ſurmounts <hi>what aſſembles things of the ſame Nature.</hi> Nor have we leſs Difficulty to believe, that Taſte is well explained, when he ſays it conſiſts in the Mixture of Dryneſs, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, and Heat; chiefly if we put, inſtead of theſe Words, the Definitions this Philoſopher has given of them, as it would be uſeful to do, if they were good. And it may be alſo, that we could not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtead of the Definitions of Hunger and Thirſt, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives of them by ſaying, that Hunger is the Deſire of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Dry,</hi> and Thirſt the Deſire of <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Moiſt,</hi> we ſhould ſubſtitute the Definition of theſe Words, calling Hunger, <hi>The Deſire of what aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles things of the ſame Nature, and of what is eaſily kept within its own Limits, and difficultly in the Limits of others; and define Thirſt, the Deſire of what aſſembles things of the ſame, and of different Natures, and of what cannot be eaſily contained in its own Limits, but eaſily in the Limits of others.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:107782:112"/>
                        <p>Certainly 'tis a very uſeful Rule to diſcover, if we have defined Terms well, and not to deceive our ſelves in our Reaſonings, only often to put the Definition in the Place of the thing defined: For by that means we know whether the Terms are equivocal, and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Relation falſe and imperfect: Or if we reaſon conſequently. This being granted, what can we ſay of the Arguments of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which become an impertinent and ridiculous Piece of Nonſence, when we make uſe of this Rule? And what muſt we ſay likewiſe of all thoſe that reaſon only upon the falſe and confuſed Idea's of the Senſes, ſince this Rule which preſerves Light and Evidence in all juſt and ſolid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, only breeds Confuſion in their Diſcourſes.</p>
                        <p>It is not poſſible to expoſe the Fantaſticalneſs and Extravagances of the Explanations that <hi>Aristotle</hi> gives of all ſorts of Matters, when the Subjects he treats of are ſimple and eaſie, his Errors are ſimple, and very eaſily diſcovered, but when he pretends to explain compounded things, and ſuch as depend upon many Cauſes, his Errors are at leaſt as compounded as the Subjects he treats on, and it is impoſſible to take them in Pieces ſo as to diſcover them all to others.</p>
                        <p>This great <hi>Genius,</hi> which they pretend, has done ſo well in his Rules for Definitions, did not ſo much as know what things were neceſſary to be defined: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, putting no Diſtinction between a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct knowledge, and a Senſible one, he imagined he was able to know and explain things to others, which he had no diſtinct Idea of himſelf. Definitions muſt explain both the Nature of Things, and the Terms which compoſe them, and ſtir up in the Mind, diſtinct and clear Idea's of them. But 'tis impoſſible, after this manner, to define the Senſible Qualities of Heat, Cold, Colour, Taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when we confound the Cauſe with the Effect, and the Motion of Bodies, with the Senſation which accompanies it, becauſe Senſations being Modifications of the Soul, which we know not by clear Idea's, but only by an inward Senſation, as I have explained in the third Book, it is impoſſible to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix Words to Idea's we have not.</p>
                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:107782:113"/>
                        <p>As we have clear and diſtinct Idea's of a Circle, a Square, a Triangle, and ſo diſtinctly know the Nature of them, we may give good Definitions thereof: We can even deduce the Idea's we have of theſe Figures, all their Properties, and explain them to others, by Terms to which theſe Idea's are affixed; but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not define either Heat or Cold, being only Senſible Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, for we know them neither diſtinctly nor by Idea, but only by Conſcience or Internal Senſation.</p>
                        <p>Nor muſt we define Heat, which is external, by any Effects: For if we ſubſtitute in its Place, the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we ſhall give it, we ſhall ſoon ſee that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition will only deceive us.</p>
                        <p>If for inſtance, we define Heat to be <hi>what aſſembles things of the ſame kind,</hi> without ſaying any thing more; we may, in following this Definition, take ſuch things for Heat, as have no Relation to it. We may ſay, that the Loadſtone aſſembles the Filings of Iron, and ſeparates them from thoſe of Silver, becauſe it is hot; that a Pigeon eats Hemp-Seed, and leaves other Grain, becauſe ſhe is hot: That a Covetous Man ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates his Gold from his Silver, becauſe he is hot: In fine, there is no Extravagancy that this Definition will not engage us in, if we were ſtupid enough to follow it. This Definition then does not explain the Nature of Heat, nor can we make uſe of it to deduce all its Properties, ſince if we keep preciſely to its Terms, we conclude Impertinences, and if we put it in the Place of the thing defined, we ſhall have a ſtrange Piece of Nonſence.</p>
                        <p>Yet, if we carefully diſtinguiſh Heat from the Cauſe of it, although we cannot define it, ſince it is a Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Soul, whereof we have no Idea, we may define the Cauſe of it, ſince we have a diſtinct Idea of Motion. But Care muſt be had, that Heat, taken for ſuch a Motion, does not always cauſe the Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heat in us. For Water, for inſtance, is hot, ſince its Parts are fluid and in Motion; and 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that Fiſh feel it warm, at leaſt warmer than Ice, whoſe Parts are more in Reſt, but it is cold in relation to us, becauſe it has leſs Motion than the Parts of our
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107782:113"/>Bodies: For what hath leſs Motion than another Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is in ſome manner in reſt, in reſpect to that Body. So that 'tis not in Relation to the Motion of the Fibres of our Bodies, that we muſt define the Cauſe of Heat, or the Motion which excites it: We muſt, if we can, define this Motion abſolutely and in it ſelf, and then, the Definitions we ſhall give, may ſerve to diſcover the Nature and Properties of Heat.</p>
                        <p>I do not think my ſelf obliged to examine the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> any further, and to unravel the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly confuſed and perplext Errors of this Author. It ſeems to me, that I have already ſhewn that he does not prove his four Elements, and that he defines them ill: That his Elementary Qualities are not ſuch as he pretends, that he knows not the Nature of them, and that all ſecond Qualities are not compounded of them. And laſtly, although we ſhould grant him, that all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were compoſed of four Elements, as ſecond Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt, his whole Syſtem would be uſeleſs in a Search after Truth, ſince his Idea's are not clear enough always to preſerve Evidence in our Ratioti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
                        <p>If 'tis doubted, that I have not related the true Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it may eaſily be ſeen by examining the Books he has writ of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> of <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Corruption;</hi> for 'tis from them that I have taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that I have ſaid. I had no Deſign to relate any thing of his Eight Books of Phyſicks, becauſe there is ſome learned Men who pretend, that 'tis only a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Logick: And 'tis very probable, ſince we find there many indetermined and trifling Words.</p>
                        <p>As <hi>Atiſtotle</hi> often contradicts himſelf, and as we may maintain almoſt any manner of Opinion from ſome Paſſages taken out of him, I doubt not but we may prove by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> even ſome Opinions, contrary to thoſe I have attributed to him; but I am not afraid of it, it is ſufficient that I have the Book by me I cited him from, to prove what I have ſaid. Nay, I ſhall not give my ſelf any great Trouble to examine whether theſe Books are <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s or not, I take them as for ſuch, and as they are commonly received: For
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:107782:114"/>we ought not to diſquiet our ſelves to know the true Genealogy of things, for which we have no Eſteem.</p>

                        <p>THAT it may not be ſaid, I only deſtroy without eſtabliſhing any thing certain and indiſputable in this Work. It will be proper to ſhew. in a few Words, the Order we ought to keep in our Studies, to avoid being deceived; and that I even note ſome moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Truths and Sciences, in which we may meet with ſuch Evidence, as we cannot hinder our ſelves from conſenting to them without ſuffering the ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of our Reaſon. I ſhall not explain theſe Truths and Sciences at large, becauſe 'tis already done: I do not pretend to make a new Impreſſion of other Perſons Works, but content my ſelf with referring to them. I will only ſhew the Order we ought to keep in our Studies, always to preſerve Evidence in our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
                        <p>Of all our Diſcoveries, the firſt is the Exiſtence of our Souls; all our Thoughts are undoubted Proofs of it, for there is nothing more evident than whatever actually thinks, is actually ſomething. But if it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to know the Exiſtence of our Souls, it is not ſo eaſie to know the Eſſence and Nature of them. If we would know what it is, we muſt above all things, take great care, not to confound it with the things it is united to. If we doubt, if we will, if we reaſon, we muſt only believe that the Soul is a thing which doubts, wills, reaſons, and nothing more, provided we have no Proof of its having any other Properties. For we know our Souls only by the Internal Senſation
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:107782:114"/>we have of them: We muſt not take our Soul for our Body, nor for the Blood, nor Animal Spirits, nor for Fire, nor an infinite number of other things for which Philoſophers have taken it. We muſt believe of the Soul, only what we cannot hinder our ſelves from believing of it; and what we are fully convinced of by the internal Senſation we have of our ſelves, for otherwiſe we ſhould be deceived. Thus we may know by a ſimple Proſpect or an internal Senſation, what can be known of the Soul, without being obliged to make ſuch Arguments as may be Erroneous: For when we reaſon the Memory Acts; and where we make uſe of our Memory, we may be deceived; perhaps there is ſome Ill Genius on which we depend in our Diſcoveries, and which diverts it ſelf in deceiving us.</p>
                        <p>If for inſtance, I ſuppoſe a God who took pleaſure in ſeducing me, I am well perſwaded he could not deceive me in any ſimple Diſcoveries, as in thoſe whereby I know that I am, or of what I think, or that twice 2 are 4. For although I ſhould really ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a God, and as powerful a one as I can feign to my ſelf, I find that in this extravagant Suppoſition I could not doubt that I was, or that twice 2 were equal to 4, becauſe I perceived theſe things by a ſimple view, without the uſe of my Memory.</p>
                        <p>But when I argue, not ſeeing evidently the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of my Reaſonings, and only remember that I have evidently ſeen them: If this deceiving Deity joyns this Memory to falſe Principles, as he might do if he would, I ſhould only reaſon falſly, like thoſe that make long Computations, imagining they remember well how they have known that 9 times 9 makes 72, or that 21 is a prime Number, or ſome ſuch-like Error, from whence they draw falſe Concluſions.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is neceſſary to know God, and to know that he is no Deceiver, if we will be fully convinced that the moſt certain Sciences, as Arithmetick and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, are true Sciences; for without that their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is not full, and we may ſtill refuſe our Aſſent. And it is further neceſſary to know by a ſimple View, and not by Reaſoning, that God is no Deceiver, ſince
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107782:115"/>that may always be falſe, if we ſuppoſe God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us.</p>
                        <p>All common Proofs of the Exiſtence and Perfections of God, taken from the Exiſtence and Perfections of his Creatures, have this Defect it ſeems, That they convince not the Mind by a ſimple View: All theſe Proofs are Reaſonings, which are convincing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: But being Reaſonings, they are not convincing, if we ſuppoſe an ill <hi>Genius</hi> which deceives us. They ſufficiently prove that there is a Power Superior to us, for even this Extravagant Suppoſition eſtabliſheth it: But they do not fully convince that there is a God, or an Infinitely Perfect Being. So in theſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the Concluſion is more evident than the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                        <p>It is more plain that there is a Power Superior to us, than that there is a World; ſince there is no Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that can hinder us from demonſtrating this Superior Power, whereas ſuppoſing an ill <hi>Genius</hi> which delights to deceive us, it is impoſſible to prove there is a World: For we might always conceive, that this Ill <hi>Genius</hi> would give us Senſations of things, which exiſted not: As our Dreams and certain Sickneſſes make us ſee things that never were; and make us even effectively feel Pain in our Imaginary Members which we have loſt, or which we never had.</p>
                        <p>But the Proofs of the Exiſtence and Perfections of God, taken from the Idea we have of Infinity, are Proofs from a ſimple View. We ſee that there is a God, as ſoon as we behold Infinity, becauſe neceſſary Exiſtence is included in the Idea of Infinity, and there is nothing but Infinity to which we can give the Idea we have of an Infinite Being. We ſee alſo that God is no Deceiver, becauſe knowing that he is infinitely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and that Infinity wants no Perfection, we ſee clearly that he will not ſeduce us, and even that he cannot, ſince he is not capable of willing it. So that there is a God, and a True God, who cannot deceive us, although he does not always enlighten us; and though we often deceive our ſelves when we think he enlightens us. All theſe Truths are ſeen at one
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107782:115"/>view by an attentive Mind, although we ſeem here to uſe a train of Arguments to ſhew them to others. We may ſuppoſe them as undoubted Principles upon which we may reaſon; for having firſt diſcovered that God is not pleaſed with deceiving us, we may then be permitted to reaſon.</p>
                        <p>It is evident, that the Certainty of Faith alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon this Principle, That there is a God which is not capable of deceiving us. For the Exiſtence of God, and Infallibility of the Divine Authority, are rather Natural Knowledges, and Notions common to Minds that are capable of a Serious Attention, than Articles of Faith: Although it be a particular Gift of God, to have a Mind capable of a ſufficient Attention, to apprehend, and be willing to apprehend theſe Truths as we ought.</p>
                        <p>From this Principle, <hi>That God is no Deceiver,</hi> we may alſo conclude, That we certainly have a Body to which we are united after a very particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that we are ſurrounded with many others. For we are Internally convinced of their Exiſtence, by the continual Senſations that God produces in us, and which we cannot correct by Reaſon without hurting our Faith; although we may by Reaſon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Senſations which repreſent them to us, with certain Qualities and Perfections which they have not. So that we ought not to believe them ſuch as we ſee them, or imagine them, but only that they Exiſt, and are ſuch as we conceive them by our Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>But that we may reaſon orderly, we ought not yet to examine whether or no we have a Body, and if there are any others about us, or whether we have only Senſations of Bodies which Exiſt not. Theſe Queſtions include too great Difficulties, and it is not perhaps ſo neceſſary to reſolve them to perfect our Knowledge as we may imagine, nor even to have an exact Knowledge of Phyſicks, Morality, and ſome other Sciences.</p>
                        <p>We have in our ſelves the Idea's of Numbers and Extenſion, whoſe Exiſtence is undoubted, and whoſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107782:116"/>Nature is immutable, which would eternally furniſh our Thoughts, if we would know all their Relations. And it is neceſſary for us to begin to exerciſe our Minds upon theſe Idea's, for Reaſons that will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to remark, whereof the chief are theſe three.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, That theſe Idea's are the moſt clear and evident of all: For if to ſhun Error we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to preſerve Evidence in our Reaſonings, it is plain that we ought rather to reaſon upon the Idea's of Numbers and Extenſion, than upon the confuſed and compound Idea's of Phyſicks, Morality, Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, Chymiſtry, and all other Sciences.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, Theſe Idea's are the moſt diſtinct and exact of all, chiefly thoſe of Numbers. So that the Habit we gain in Arithmetick and Geometry, of not contenting our ſelves without knowing preciſely the Relations of things, gives the Mind a certain Exactneſs that thoſe have not, who content themſelves with the Probability that is to be met with in other Sciences.</p>
                        <p>The third and greateſt of all is, That theſe Idea's are the immutable Rules and common Meaſures, of all other things that we know or can know. Thoſe who perfectly know the Relations of Numbers and Figures, or rather the Art of making the Compariſons neceſſary for the knowing their Relations, have a kind of univerſal Science, and a moſt certain means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover evidently and certainly whatſoever exceeds not the common limits of the Mind. But thoſe that have not this Art, can never certainly diſcover any Truths, if but a little compounded, although they have very clear Idea's of thoſe things whoſe compounded Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they endeavour to know.</p>
                        <p>Theſe or the like, are the Reaſons which induced the Ancients to make young Men ſtudy Arithmetick, Algebra, and Geometry: Without doubt they knew that Arithmetick and Algebra gave a certain Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Mind, that could not be acquired by other Studies; and that Geometry ſo well regulates the Imagination that it is not eaſily confounded; for this
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107782:116"/>Faculty of the Soul, ſo neceſſary for the Sciences, acquires a certain juſt Extenſion by the uſe of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, which promotes and preſerves the clear view of the Mind in the moſt perplexing Difficulties.</p>
                        <p>If we would then always preſerve Evidence in our Perceptions, and diſcover the pure Truth without any Obſcurity or Mixture of Error, we ought firſt to ſtudy Arithmetick, Algebra and Geometry, at leaſt after having acquired ſome Knowledge of our ſelves and the Soveraign Being. If we would have any Book which Facilitates theſe Sciences, I would prefer <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>'s Meditations to know God and our ſelves; and to learn Arithmetick and Algebra, we may read the <hi>Mathematical Elements;</hi> for common Geometry, <hi>Tacquet</hi>'s <hi>Elements;</hi> and for Conick Sections, and the Reſolution of Geometrick Problems, <hi>De la Here</hi>'s <hi>Conicks, his Geometrick Places, and Conſtruction of Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to which we may add <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Geometry.</p>
                        <p>I would not adviſe to the reading of the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Elements</hi> for Arithmetick and Algebra, if I knew of any Author that had clearly demonſtrated theſe Sciences; but the Truth obliges me to a thing which ſome Men will oppoſe. Algebra and Arithmetick being abſolutely neceſſary to diſcover compounded Truths, I believe it a Duty to teſtifie ſome Eſteem for a Book which directs very far in theſe Sciences, and which, according to the Opinion of ſome Learned Men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains them more clearly than any one has yet done.</p>
                        <p>When with Care and Application we have ſtudied theſe general Sciences, we ſhall evidently diſcover a great number of Truths, that are for all exact and particular Sciences. Afterwards we may ſtudy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks and Morality, becauſe theſe Sciences are very uſeful, although they are not ſo fit to make the Mind exact and penetrating. And if we would always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Evidence in our Perceptions, we muſt be very careful that we are never prejudiced in favour of any Principle that is not evident; and from which the <hi>Chineſe</hi> for inſtance would not be ſuppoſed to diſſent after, having throughly weighed and conſidered it.</p>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:107782:117"/>
                        <p>So for Phyſicks we muſt only admit the Notions common to all Men, <hi>viz.</hi> The Axioms of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians, and clear Idea's of Extenſion, Figure, Motion and Reſt, or any others as clear as theſe. It may perhaps be ſaid, That the Eſſence of Matter is not Extenſion, but what ſignifies that? It is enough that the World which we conceive to be formed of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, appears like to that which we ſee, if it be not of this matter which is uſeleſs and unintelligible, although we make ſuch a noiſe about it.</p>
                        <p>It is not abſolutely neceſſary to examine whether there are indeed External Beings which anſwer to theſe Idea's, for we reaſon not upon theſe Beings, but upon their Idea's: We ought only to take care that the Reaſonings we make upon the Properties of things, agree with the Senſations we have of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That what we think perfectly agrees with Experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we endeavour in Phyſicks to diſcover the Order and Connection of Effects with their Cauſes, or in Bodies if they Exiſt, or in the Senſations we have of them if they have no Being.</p>
                        <p>Indeed we cannot doubt whether there are actually any Bodies, when we conſider that God is no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, or reflect upon the juſt Order which he hath inſtituted in our Senſations, whether in Natural Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, or in thoſe things only that happen to make us believe what we could not naturally comprehend: But it is not neceſſary at firſt ſight to make deep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, upon a thing which no body doubts of, and which is not very uſeful in the Knowledge of Phyſicks, if conſidered as a true Science.</p>
                        <p>Nor muſt we trouble our ſelves much to know, whether there is, or is not, any other Qualities in thoſe Bodies that ſurround us, than ſuch as we have clear Idea's of, for we muſt reaſon only according to our Idea's: And if there is any thing elſe, of which we have not a dear, diſtinct, and particular Idea, we can never know any thing of it, nor reaſon juſtly upon it: Whereas if we reaſon according to our Idea's, we follow Nature, and diſcover that it is not ſo hidden as we commonly imagine.</p>
                        <pb n="239" facs="tcp:107782:117"/>
                        <p>So thoſe that have not ſtudied the Properties of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, often imagine that 'tis not poſſible to reſolve cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Problems, although moſt Simple and Eaſie; and thoſe that have not thought upon the Properties of Extenſion, Figure and Motion, are extreamly inclined to believe and maintain, that Phyſical Queſtions are inexplicable. We muſt not ſtop at the Opinion of thoſe that have examined nothing, or have examined nothing with a neceſſary Application: For although there are few Truths concerning Natural Things which are fully demonſtrated, it is certain that there are ſome general ones, of which it is not poſſible to doubt, although it is very poſſible not to think of them, be ignorant, and deny them.</p>
                        <p>If we would meditate regularly, and with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Application, we ſhould diſcover many of theſe certain Truths that I ſpeak of: But that we may the more eaſily diſcover them, it is requiſite to read <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Principles carefully, without receiving any thing he ſays, except when the Force and Evidence of his Reaſons permit us not to doubt of it.</p>
                        <p>As Morality is the moſt neceſſary of all Sciences, we muſt alſo ſtudy it very carefully, for 'tis chiefly in that Science that 'tis dangerous to follow the Opinions of Men: But that we may not deceive our ſelves in it, but preſerve Evidence in our Perceptions, we muſt only meditate upon undoubted Principles, ſuch as are confeſſed by all thoſe whoſe Minds are not blinded with Pride; for there is no undoubted Principle of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for Spirits of Fleſh and Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch as aſpire to the Quality of great Wits. Theſe ſort of Men comprehend not the moſt ſimple Truths; or if they comprehend them, at leaſt they always diſpute them, through a Spirit of Contradiction, and to preſerve ſuch a Reputation.</p>
                        <p>Some of theſe moſt general Principles of Morality are, That God having made all things for himſelf, he has created our Minds to know, and our Hearts to love him: That being alſo as Juſt and Powerful as he is, we cannot be Happy if we do not follow his Orders, nor Unhappy if we do: That our Nature
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107782:118"/>is Corrupt, that our Minds depend upon our Bodies, our Reaſon upon our Senſes, and our Wills upon our Paſſions: That we are uncapable to do what we ſee clearly to be our Duties; and that we have need of a Saviour. There are alſo many other Principles of Morality, as, That a retreat from the eager Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the World and Repentance, are neceſſary to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite us from Senſible Objects, and to increaſe that which we have with intelligible and true Goods, I mean, thoſe of the Mind: That we cannot enjoy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pleaſure without becoming Slaves to it: That we muſt never undertake any thing through the Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paſſion: Nor ſeek an Eſtabliſhment in this Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But becauſe theſe laſt Principles depend upon the precedent, and on the Knowledge of Man, they ought not immediately to paſs for undoubted. If we conſider theſe Principles orderly, and with as much Care and Application as the weight of the Subject requires; and receive for true only the Concluſions conſequently deduced from theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, we ſhall have a certain Morality, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agrees with that of the Goſpel, although it is not compleat and large.</p>
                        <p>It is true, in Moral Reaſonings, it is not ſo eaſie to preſerve Evidence and Exactneſs, as in ſome other Sciences; and the Knowledge of Man is abſolutely neceſſary to thoſe that would make any great Progreſs: And this is the reaſon that the generality of Men do not ſucceed in it. They will not conſult themſelves to know the Weakneſs of their own Nature: They omit to enquire of the Maſter who inwardly teaches them his own Will, which is the Immutable and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law, and the true Principles of Morality. They do not hear him with Pleaſure who ſpeaks not to their Senſes, who anſwers not according to their Deſires, nor Flatters their Secret Pride: They have no reſpect for ſuch words as do not dazle the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which are pronounced without a Noiſe, and are never clearly heard but in the Silence of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Yet with Pleaſure and Deference they conſult <hi>Ariſtotle, Seneca,</hi> and ſome new Philoſophers, who
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107782:118"/>ſeduce them either by the Obſcurity of their Words, the Turn of their Expreſſions, or Probability of their Reaſons.</p>
                        <p>Since the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> we eſteem only what relates to the Preſervation of the Body, and Conveniency of Life: And becauſe we diſcover theſe ſort of Goods only by the Means of our Senſes, we make uſe of them in all Occurrences. The Eternal Wiſdom who is our true Life, and the only Light which can illuminate us, often ſhines before the Blind, and ſpeaks only to the Deaf, when it ſpeaks in the Receſſes of the Soul; for we are almoſt always out of our ſelves. As we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually interrogate all Creatures to learn ſome new Good which we enquire after, it is requiſite, as I have already ſaid, that this Wiſdom preſents it ſelf before us without our going out of our ſelves, to teach us by ſenſible Words, and convincing Examples, the way to arrive at true Felicity. God continually imprints a Natural Love in us for him, that we may always Love him; and by this ſame Motion of Love we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Eſtrange our ſelves from him, by running with all the Power he has given us after Senſible Goods, which he has forbid us to do. So that willing to be loved by us, he renders himſelf Senſible, and preſents himſelf before us, by the Delights of his Grace to fix all our Vain Agitatitions, and to begin our Cure, by Senſations or Delectations like to thoſe which had been the Original of our Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I do not pretend that Men may, by the Power of their Minds, ſo eaſily diſcover all the Rules of Morality which are neceſſary to Salvation, and much leſs that they are able to act according to what they know; for their Heart is yet more Corrupted than their Minds. I only ſay, that if they admit none but evident Principles, and conſequently reaſon upon theſe Principles, they will diſcover even the very Truths that we learn in the Bible; becauſe 'tis the ſame Wiſdom which immediately ſpeaks from it ſelf to thoſe who diſcover Truths from the Evidence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; and who ſpeaks by the Holy Scriptures to thoſe who learn it from their Senſes.</p>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:107782:119"/>
                        <p>We muſt then ſtudy Morality in the Goſpel to ſpare our ſelves the Trouble of Meditation, and Certainly to learn thoſe Laws according to which we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our Manners, For thoſe who are not contented with Certainty, becauſe it only convinces the Mind, without enlightning it, muſt carefully Meditate upon theſe Laws, and deduce them from their Natural Principles, that they may evidently diſcover by their Reaſon, what they already know by Faith, with an entire Certainty. This way they will be convinced that the Goſpel is the moſt Solid of all Books; That <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> perfectly knew the Diſorder and Diſtemper of Nature: That he has procured a Remedy the moſt Uſeful for us, and the moſt Worthy of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But that the Light of Philoſophers is only thick Darkneſs, and their brighteſt Vertues only an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Pride; and in a word, that <hi>Ariſtotle, Seneca,</hi> &amp;c. are only at beſt but Men, to ſay no worſe of them.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the firſt Rule which reſpects Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Queſtions.</head>
                        <p>WE have ſufficiently explained the General Rule for <hi>Method,</hi> which chiefly regards the Subject of our Studies, and to prove that <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has exactly followed it in his Syſtem of the World, but that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and his Followers have not obſerved it. It is now proper to deſcend to particular Rules, which are neceſſary to reſolve all ſorts of Queſtions.</p>
                        <p>The Queſtions that may be formed upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Subjects are of diverſe kinds, of which it will not be eaſie to give a particular Enumeration, but theſe that follow are the chief of them. Sometimes we enquire after the unknown Cauſes of ſome known Effects; and ſometimes ſeek unknown Effects by their
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:107782:119"/>known Cauſes. The Fire burns, and diſſipates the Wood, we ſeek the Cauſe of it. Fire conſiſts in a very great Motion of the Fiery Particles; we would know what Effects this Motion is capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, if it can harden Dirt, and melt Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We ſeek ſometimes the Nature of a thing by its Properties; and ſometimes knowing the Nature we ſeek the Properties of things: We know, or at leaſt ſuppoſe, that Light is tranſmitted in an inſtant, that yet it is re-united and reflected by the means of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Mirror, in ſuch ſort, that it penetrates the moſt Solid Bodies; and we would make uſe of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties to diſcover the Nature of it. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, We know that all the Spaces which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Earth and Heaven, are full of little Spherical Bodies extreamly agitated, and which continually fly from the Sun: And we would know if theſe little Bodies can tranſmit themſelves in an inſtant, or if being reflected by a Concave Mirror, can re-unite, and diſſipate or penetrate the moſt Solid Bodies.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes we ſeek all the Parts from the whole; and ſometimes a whole by its Parts: We ſeek all the unknown Parts of a whole that is known; when we ſeek all the <hi>Alliquot</hi> parts of a Number, all the <hi>Roots</hi> of an <hi>Equation,</hi> all the right Angles which a Figure contains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we ſeek an unknown whole, whoſe Parts are known, when we ſeek the Sum of many Numbers, the Area of many Figures, the Capacity of different Veſſels; or we ſeek a whole which has one of its parts known, and the others, although unknown, include ſome known Relation with what is unknown: As when we enquire what that Number is whereof we have 15 a known part, and the other which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it, is the half or third of the unknown Number: Or when we ſeek an unknown Number which is equal to 15, and to twice the Root of the unknown Number.</p>
                        <p>In fine, We ſometimes enquire if certain things are equal or like to others, or how far they are unequal or different: As when we would know if <hi>Saturn</hi> is greater than <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or how near their Magnitudes
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107782:120"/>are alike: If the Air at <hi>Rome</hi> is hotter than that at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> or what difference between them.</p>
                        <p>What is general in all Queſtions is, that we form them only to know ſome Truths; and becauſe all Truths are but Relations; we may ſay generally, that in all Queſtions, we ſeek only the Knowledge of ſome Relations, whether Relations between things, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between Idea's, or Relations between things and their Idea's.</p>
                        <p>There are Relations of many Kinds, there are ſome between the Nature of things, between their Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, their Parts, their Attributes, Qualities, Effects, Cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we may reduce them all to two, <hi>viz.</hi> the Relations of <hi>Magnitude,</hi> and Relations of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> by calling all thoſe Relations of <hi>Magnitude;</hi> which are between things conſidered as capable of <hi>More</hi> or <hi>Leſs;</hi> and all others Relations of <hi>Qualities.</hi> Thus we may ſay, that all Queſtions tend to the Diſcovery of ſome Relations of Magnitude or Quality.</p>
                        <p>The firſt and chief of all Rules is, to know moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the State of the Queſtion propoſed to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to have very clear Idea's of its Terms, to be able to compare, and by this means diſcover the unknown Relations.</p>
                        <p>We muſt therefore firſt perceive very clearly the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Relation that we ſeek; for it is evident, that if we had no certain Mark to diſcover this unknown Relation when we look for it, or when we would find it, it would be in vain for us to enquire after it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, as much as poſſible, we muſt render thoſe Idea's diſtinct, which anſwer to the Terms of the Queſtion, by taking away all Equivocal Terms, and make them clear, by conſidering them with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Attention: For if theſe Idea's are ſo confuſed or obſcure, that we cannot make the Compariſons ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for diſcovering the Relations we ſeek, we are not yet in a Condition of reſolving the Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, we muſt conſider with great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the Conditions expreſt in a Queſtion, if there is any; becauſe, without that, we have only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Notion of the State of the Queſtion: Beſides, the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:107782:120"/>Conditons generally ſhew the Way for reſolving it. So that having once well conceived the State of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and Conditions of it, we know what we ſeek, and ſometimes the Way that we muſt take to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it.</p>
                        <p>It is true, there is not always ſome Conditions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in Queſtions; but then theſe Queſtions are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and we may reſolve them many Ways, as if a Square, Number, or Triangle is required, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecifying any more; or elſe 'tis becauſe he that propoſes them, knows not the means of reſolving them, or elſe hides them with a Deſign to perplex the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: As if it is required to find two mean Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals between two Lines, without adding, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſection of the Circle and Parabola, or Circle and Elipſis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is therefore abſolutely neceſſary, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter by which we know what we ſeek, ſhould be very diſtinct and not Equivocal, and ſpecifie only what we ſeek, otherwiſe we can never be certain of having reſolved the Queſtion propoſed. We muſt likewiſe take care to retrench from the Queſtion, whatever Conditions may perplex it, and without which it is compleat: For they unneceſſarily divide the Capacity of the Mind. Nay, we cannot be ſaid to know the State of a Queſtion, when the Conditions which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it are uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, if a Queſtion were propoſed in theſe Terms; whether a Man being ſprinkled with ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and covered with a Garland of Flowers, can be able to reſt, although he ſee nothing that can agitate him. We muſt know whether the Word <hi>Man</hi> is not Metaphorical; or the Word <hi>Rest</hi> Equivocal, if it is not taken in Relation to Local Motion, or in Relation to the Paſſions, as theſe Words, <hi>although he ſee nothing that is able to agitate him,</hi> ſeem to note. We muſt know if the Conditions, <hi>being ſprinkled with ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and crowned with a Garland of Flowers,</hi> are Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. Afterwards, the State of this Ridiculous and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined Queſtion being clearly known, we may eaſily reſolve it, by ſaying that we only need put a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:107782:121"/>Man into a Ship, according to the Conditions expreſt in the Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>The Artifice of thoſe that propoſe ſuch like Queſtions, is to joyn Conditions to them which ſeem to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, although they are not, to divert the Mind of thoſe they propoſe them towards things unuſeful to be reſolved. As in that Queſtion that Servants commonly offer to Children. I have ſeen, ſay they unto them, Hunters or Fiſhers, carry away with them what they could not take, and caſt into the Water what they took. The Mind being prejudiced with the Idea of Fiſhermen angling for Fiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it cannot conceive what they mean, and all the Diffiulty there is to reſolve this trifling Queſtion, proceeds from their not having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it clearly, and not thinking that Fiſhermen, as well as others, ſometimes look in their Cloaths for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little Animals, which they throw away as ſoon as they have taken them, and ſtill carry with them what they cannot catch.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes alſo, there are not all the neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in a Queſtion for the anſwering it, and that makes it at leaſt as difficult as when unuſeful ones are added: For inſtance in this, to make a Man immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, without binding or hurting him; or rather, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put a Man's little Finger in his own Ear, by this Poſture, to make him ſo immoveable, that he cannot ſtir from the Place where he is put, until his little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is taken from his Ear again. This at firſt appears impoſſible, and it is ſo indeed, for we can walk very well, although our little Finger be in our Ear. But here is a Condition wanting, which would remove all Difficulty, if it was expreſſed,<hi>viz.</hi> That he muſt be made to embrace ſome Pillar or ſomething like it, with that Arm, whereof the Finger is in his Ear; for then he cannot get from the Place without taking his Finger from his Ear. It is not added as a Condition of a Queſtion, that there is yet ſome other thing to do, on purpoſe that the Mind ſhould not ſeek for it nor diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it; But thoſe who undertake to reſolve theſe ſort of Queſtions, muſt make all neceſſary Demands to clear the Point wherein the Difficulty of the Queſtion conſiſts.</p>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:107782:121"/>
                        <p>Theſe Arbitrary Queſtions ſeem to be trifling, and ſo indeed they are in one Sence; for we learn nothing by reſolving them: Yet are they not ſo different from Natural Queſtions, as perhaps we may think them to be; we muſt do very nigh the ſame things to reſolve both. For if the Craft and Malice of Men make Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Queſtions perplexing and difficult to reſolve; Natural Effects are alſo in themſelves incompaſſed with Obſcurity and Darkneſs: And theſe Darkneſſes muſt be diſperſed by the Attention of the Mind; and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, which are kind of Demands that we make to the Author of Nature, even as we take away Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal and uſeleſs Circumſtances from Arbitrary Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by Attention of the Mind, and by the proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands we make to thoſe who propoſe them. But let us explain theſe things Methodically, and in a more Serious and Inſtructive Manner.</p>
                        <p>There is a great Number of Queſtions which ſeem very difficult, becauſe we underſtand them not, and which therefore want an Explication: Yet, which ought rather to paſs for Axioms, than true Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; for it ſeems to me, that we ought not to place in the Number of Queſtions, certain undoubted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, whoſe Terms we conceive.</p>
                        <p>We demand, for inſtance, as a Queſtion difficult to be reſolved, whether or no the Soul is immortal; becauſe thoſe that make the Queſtion, or that pretend to reſolve it, do not clearly conceive the Terms of it. As the Words <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Immortal</hi> ſignifie different things, and know not how they are underſtood; ſo they cannot reſolve whether it is Immortal or not: For they neither know preciſely what they demand, nor what they ſeek.</p>
                        <p>By this Word <hi>Soul,</hi> we may underſtand a Subſtance which thinks, wills, feels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may take the Soul for the Circulation of the Blood, and Configuration of the Parts of the Body; or we may take it for the Blood and Animal Spirits. So by this Word <hi>Immortal,</hi> we mean what cannot periſh by the ordinary Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or elſe what can never change; or what can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt nor diſſipate like a Vapour or Smoke.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107782:122"/>Thus, ſuppoſe we take the Words <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Immortal</hi> in ſome one of theſe Significations; the leaſt Attention of Mind will make us able to judge whether it is Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or not.</p>
                        <p>For firſt, 'tis plain that the <hi>Soul,</hi> taken in the firſt Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for a Subſtance which thinks, is Immortal, if we alſo take <hi>Immortal</hi> in the firſt Senſe, for what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not periſh by the common Power of Nature; for 'tis not even conceivable that any Subſtance can become nothing; we muſt have Recourſe to the extraordinary Power of God, to conceive it poſſible.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Soul is immortal, if we take <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> in the third Senſe; for what cannot corrupt, nor reſolve into a Vapour or Smoke; for 'tis evident, that what cannot be divided into an infinite Number of Parts, cannot corrupt or be reſolved into a Vapour.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the Soul is not Immortal, if we take <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi> in the ſecond Senſe, for what cannot change: For we have ſufficient convincing Proofs of the Variations of our Soul: That ſometimes it feels Pain, ſometimes Pleaſure, ſometimes it wills certain things, and then again ceaſes to will them; as being united to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it cannot be ſeparated from them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If we take the Word Soul in any other Signification, 'twill be very eaſie to ſee whether it is Immortal or not, by taking the Word Immortal in a fixed and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Senſe; ſo that what makes theſe Queſtions diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, is becauſe we conceive them not diſtinctly, and the Terms which expreſs them are Equivocal; ſo that they have rather need of Explanation than Proof.</p>
                        <p>It is true, ſome Perſons are ſtupid enough, and others ſufficiently Imaginative; to take the Soul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for a certain Configuration of the Parts of the Brain, arid Motion of the Spirits, and it is certainly impoſſible to prove, to theſe ſort of Men, that the Soul is Imortal and cannot periſh: For on the contrary, 'tis evident, that the Soul, taken in the Senſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, is Mortal; ſo that 'tis not a Queſtion difficult to reſolve, but a Propoſition difficult to make Men underſtand which have not the ſame Idea's of it as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:107782:122"/>we have, and who do all they can not to have them, and to blind themſelves.</p>
                        <p>When it is asked, if the Soul is Immortal, or any other Queſtion whatever, we muſt immediately take away the Equivocal Terms, and know in what Senſe they are taken that we may be able diſtinctly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Condition of the Queſtion: And if thoſe that propoſe it, know not what they mean, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to form ſome diſtinct Notions, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them. If we ask them, and find their Idea's agree not with ours, it will be uſeleſs to anſwer them: For what Anſwer can we make to a Man, who for inſtance, imagines that a Deſire is only the Motion of ſome Spirits; and a Thought is nothing elſe but a Trace or an Image, that Objects or Spirits have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Brain; and that all the reaſoning of Men conſiſt merely in the different Situation of ſome little Parts, which are diverſely diſpoſed in the Head? To anſwer him, that the Soul, taken in the Senſe he means it is Immortal, is to deceive him, or make our ſelves ridiculous to him: But to anſwer him it is Immortal, would be in one Senſe to confirm him in an Error of the greateſt Conſequence. We muſt therefore not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him at all, but only endeavour to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter into himſelf, that he may receive the ſame Idea's as we do, of him who is only capable of enlightening him.</p>
                        <p>'Tis alſo a Queſtion which appears difficult enough to reſolve, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Beaſts have a Soul or not: Yet, when we take away the Equivocation, it ſeems no longer difficult; and the Generality of thoſe Men who think they have, do not know the Opinions of thoſe who think they have not.</p>
                        <p>We may take the Soul for ſomething Corporeal, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through the whole Body, which gives it Life and Motion, or elſe for ſomething Spiritual. Thoſe who ſay Animals have no Soul, underſtand it in the Second Senſe; for no Man ever denied but that there was in Animals ſomething Corporeal, which was the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Life and Motion, ſince they cannot even deny it to Watches. Thoſe on the contrary, who affirm Animals have Souls, mean it in the firſt Senſe; for
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107782:123"/>there are few who believe Animals have a Spiritual and indiviſible Soul, ſo that the Peripateticks and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians do both believe that Beaſts have a Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> a Corporeal Principle of their Motion; and both of them believe they have none, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them Spiritual and indiviſible.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Difference that is between the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Carteſians, is not in that the firſt believe Beaſts have Souls, and the laſt believe it not: But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that the firſt think Animals capable of feeling Pain, Pleaſure, ſeeing Colours, hearing Sounds, and generally of having all the Senſations and Paſſions that we have; and the laſt doubt it. The Carteſians di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Word Senſation to take away the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of it. For inſtance, they ſay, that when we are too near the Fire, the Particles of Wood ſtrike againſt the Hand, and ſhake the Fibres; that this ſhaking is communicated to the Brain; that it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the Animal Spirits, which are there contained, to diffuſe themſelves through the External Parts of the Body, in a proper manner to make them retire. They agree, that all theſe things, or the like, may meet in Animals, and that they certainly meet there, becauſe theſe are the Properties of Bodies; and the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks grant this.</p>
                        <p>The Carteſians further ſay, that in Man the ſhaking of the Fibres of his Brain is accompanied with a Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heat, and that the Courſe of the Animal Spirits to the Heart or Bowels, is followed with the Paſſion of Hatred or Averſion: But deny that theſe Senſations or Paſſions of the Soul is in Beaſts. The Peripateticks, on the contrary, affirm that Beaſts feel Heat as well as we; that like us, they have an Averſion for whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver incommodes them; and generally, that they are capable of all the Senſations and Paſſions that we are. The Carteſians do not think that Beaſts feel Pain or Pleaſure, or that they love or hate any thing; becauſe they admit nothing but what is material in Beaſts, and they do not believe that Senſations or Paſſions are Properties of Matter, whatever it may be. Some Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks on the contrary, think that Matter is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107782:123"/>of Senſation and Paſſion, when it is, as they ſay, Subtilized; that Beaſts may feel, by the means of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> by the means of a Matter extreamly fine and delicate; and that even the Soul is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Senſation and Paſſion, but only as it is united to this Matter.</p>
                        <p>Thus, to reſolve the Queſtion, whether Beaſts have a Soul, we muſt re-enter into our ſelves, and conſider the Idea we have of Matter, with all the Attention we are capable of. And if we conceive, that Matter, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured after ſuch manner, as Square, Round, Oval, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is capable of Pain, Pleaſure, Heat and Cold, Colour, Smells, Sound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may affirm, that the Souls of Beaſts, how material ſoever they are, may be capable of Senſation. If we conceive it not, we muſt not aſſert it is, for we muſt only affirm what we conceive: So if we conceive, that Matter, agitated up and down in a Circular, Spiral, Parabolick, Elip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Line, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be capable of Love, Hatred, Joy, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may ſay that Beaſts have the ſame Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſ with us. If we ſee it not, we muſt not ſay it, at leaſt without confeſſing, we ſpeak what we do not know. But I think it may be affirmed, that we never believe any Motion of Matter can be capable of Love or Joy, provided we think Seriouſly of it: So that to reſolve this Queſtion, if Beaſts feel; we need only take away the Equivocation, as Carteſians do; for this way we reduce it to a Simple Queſtion, that an indifferent Attention of Mind will ſuffice to reſolve it.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſuppoſing, according to the common Prejudice, that Beaſts have Souls (or at leaſt, I have not read in his Works, that he ever Seriouſly examined it, or called it in Queſtion) and perceiving well the Contradiction of ſaying, that a Soul or Subſtance that thinks, feels, deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be Material, he believed that the Souls of Beaſts were certainly Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Indiviſible. He has proved, by evident Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>L 4.</hi> de ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma &amp; ejus origine. <hi>c. 23. l. 5.</hi> de quantitate animae, and elſewhere</note> that all Souls, that is, whatever feels, imagines, fears, doubts, deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are neceſſarily Spiritual; but I have not obſerved that he had any Reaſon to ſay that Beaſts had Souls. He does not give himſelf
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107782:124"/>the Trouble to prove it, becauſe 'tis very probable that in his Time there was hardly any one that doubted of it.</p>
                        <p>Now there are ſome who endeavour wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themſelves from their Prejudices, and who call all Opinions in Queſtion, that are not maintained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clear and demonſtrative Reaſons, who begin to doubt whether Animals have a Soul capable of the ſame Senſations and Paſſions as ours, but they always find many prejudiced Defenders, who pretend to prove, that Beaſts feel, will, think and reaſon as we do, although in a much more imperfect manner.</p>
                        <p>Dogs, ſay they, know their Maſters, they love them, ſuffer patiently the Blows they receive from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they judge it advantageous for them, not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them: But for Strangers, they hate them ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that they cannot ſo much as ſuffer themſelves to be careſſed by them. All Animals have a Love for their Young Ones, and thoſe Birds that make their Neſts in the Extreme Branches of a Tree, make it plainly appear, that they fear certain Animals that would devour them: They think theſe Branches are too weak to bear their Enemies, and yet ſtrong enough to ſupport their Little Ones and Neſts too. There is amongſt the Spiders, and the moſt vile Inſects, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that looks like an Intelligence, which Animates them: For we cannot forbear admiring the Conduct of an Animal; which, although blind, finds a means to catch others in its Snares, that have both Eyes and Wings, and are bold enough to attack the greateſt Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal that is.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that all the Actions of Beaſts ſhew that there is an Intelligence, for whatever is regular declares it; a Watch even ſhews it: It is impoſſible that Chance ſhould compoſe its Wheels, there muſt be an Intelligence which has regulated its Motions. We plant a Seed in an inverſe Order, the Roots which are upwards, ſink of themſelves into the Earth; and the Germ which was turn'd towards the Earth, alſo turns again to come forth, and this teſtifies an Intelligence: This Plant is joynted at convenient Diſtances, to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107782:124"/>it ſelf; it covers its Grain with a Skin to preſerve it; if encompaſſes it with Prickles which defends it: This ſhews an Intelligence. In fine, all that we ſee Plants do, as well as Animals, certainly denotes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. All true Carteſians grant it. But they all diſtinguiſh, for they take away as much as poſſible, the Equivocation of Terms.</p>
                        <p>The Motions of Beaſts and Plants ſhew an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; but this Intelligence is not of Matter; it is diſtinct from Beaſts, as that which diſpoſes the Wheels of a Watch is diſtinct from the Watch. For indeed, this Intelligence appears infinitely wiſe, infinitely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and the ſame which has formed us in our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Belly, and given us Growth, to which we could not, by all the Efforts of our Minds, and will add one Cubit. Thus in Animals, there is neither Intelligence nor Soul, as we commonly underſtand it. They eat without Pleaſure, cry without Pain, and grow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Knowledge: They fear nothing, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and they act after ſuch a manner as intelligently ſhews that it is God who made them, that preſerves them; he has ſo formed their Bodies, that they Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinally, and without Fear, ſhun whatſoever would deſtroy them; otherwiſe we muſt grant that there is more Underſtanding in the leaſt Animal, or even in one Grain, than in the Wiſeſt Man: For it is certain, there is more different Parts, and more regular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons produced in them, than we are capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>But, as Men are accuſtomed to confound all things, and to imagine that their Soul produces in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, almoſt all the Motions and Changes that happen to it: They falſly affix to the Word Soul, the Idea of producing and preſerving Bodies. Thus they think their Soul produces in them, whatſoever is abſolutely neceſſary for the Preſervation of Life, although it know not even how the Body it Animates is compoſed: They judge it neceſſary that there ſhould be a Soul in Beaſts, to produce all the Motions and Changes which happen to them; becauſe they are like to what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in our Bodies: For Beaſts are begotten, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107782:125"/>fortified, as out Bodies are: They Drink, Eat, Sleep like us; becauſe we are wholly like Beaſts in our Bodies, and all the difference there is between us and them, is, That we have a Soul, and they have not. But the Soul we have does not form our Bodies, it digeſts not our Food, it gives neither Motion nor Heat to our Blood: It Feels, Wills and Reaſons; and animates the Body in this reſpect. It has Senſations and Paſſions which have relation to it. It is not that 'tis diffuſed through all our Members, that it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates Senſation and Life to it, for our Body can receive nothing of what occurs in our Mind. It is then plain, That the reaſon why we cannot reſolve many Queſtions, is becauſe we diſtinguiſh nor, and even forget to diſtinguiſh the different things that the ſame word may ſignifie.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes indeed we may think of diſtinguiſhing, but then often we do it ſo ill, that inſtead of taking away the Equivocation of Terms, by the Diſtinctions we give them, we make them become more obſcure. For inſtance, If it be demanded whether the Body ſees, how it ſees, and after what manner the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Soul animates the Animal Spirits, the Blood, and other living Humours, if the Teeth, Hair and Nails, are animated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we diſtinguiſh the words to live and be animated, in living or being animated with a rational Soul, or a Senſitive, or a Vegetative one; but this diſtinction does only confound the ſtate of the Queſtion, for theſe words themſelves have need of an Explanation, and it may be even that the two laſt, <hi>Vegetative</hi> and <hi>Senſitive</hi> Soul are inexplicable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, after the manner we commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them.</p>
                        <p>But if we would joyn any clear and diſtinct Idea to the word Life, we may ſay that the Life of the Soul is the Knowledge of Truth and Love of God; or rather, that its Thought is its Life: And that the Life of the Body conſiſts in the Circulation of the Blood, and juſt Temperament of Humours; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Life of the Body is the Motion of its Parts proper for its Preſervation: And then the Idea's
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:107782:125"/>applied to the word Life being clear, it will alſo be evident, 1. That the Soul cannot communicate its Life to the Body; for it cannot make it Think. 2. That it cannot give it the Life by which it is nouriſhed, grows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince it cannot ſo much as know how it muſt digeſt what it eats. 3. It can make it feel any thing, ſince Matter is incapable of Senſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus we may, without Pain, reſolve all other Queſtions that can be put upon this Subject, provided the Terms whereby they are expreſſed ſtir up clear Idea's: And it is impoſſible to reſolve them, if the Idea's of the Terms which expreſs them are confuſed and obſcure.</p>
                        <p>Yet is it not always abſolutely neceſſary to have Idea's, which perfectly repreſent the things whoſe Relations we would examine: It often ſuffices to have an imperfect or weak Knowledge of them, becauſe ſometimes we do not enquire after an exact Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Relations, as I ſhall here explain.</p>
                        <p>There are Truths or Relations of two ſorts, ſome exactly known, and others that are but imperfectly diſcovered: We exactly know the Relation between ſuch a Square and ſuch a Triangle; but we do not perfectly know the Relation between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance;</hi> we know that a Square is equal to a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, or double or treble to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but we only know that <hi>Paris</hi> is greater than <hi>Orleance,</hi> without knowing how much.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, Between imperfect Knowledges there are an infinite number of Degrees, and even all theſe Knowledges are only imperfect in relation to the more perfect ones: For inſtance, We perfectly know that <hi>Paris</hi> is greater than the <hi>Royal Place;</hi> and that Knowledge is not imperfect, but in relation to an exact Knowledge, according to which we ſhould juſtly know how much <hi>Paris</hi> is bigger than the place it includes.</p>
                        <p>Thus there are Queſtions of many ſorts. 1. There are ſome in which we ſeek the perfect Knowledge of all exact Relations, that two or many things have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves.</p>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:107782:126"/>
                        <p n="2">2. There are ſome, in which we enquire after the perfect Knowledge of ſome exact Relation between two or many things.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There are ſome, in which we ſeek a perfect Knowledge of ſome Relation that is very near exact, which is between two or more things.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And ſome, wherein we only try to know a Relation which is ſufficiently rambling and indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
                        <p>It is plain, 1. That to reſolve Queſtions of the firſt Kind, and perfectly to know all the exact Relations of Magnitude and Quality that is between two or many things, we muſt have diſtinct Idea's which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly repreſent them, and compare theſe things all poſſible ways. We may, for inſtance, reſolve all Queſtions which tend to diſcover the exact Relations which are between 2 and 8, becauſe 2 and 8 being exactly known, we may compare them together in all neceſſary manners, to diſcover their exact Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Magnitude or Quality: We may know that 8 is Quadruple of 2, that 8 and 2 are even Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and that 8 and 2 are not Squares.</p>
                        <p>It is clear in the ſecond place, That to reſolve Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the ſecond Kind, and exactly to diſcover any Relation of Magnitude or Quality which is between two or many things, it is neceſſary, and it will be ſufficient to know very diſtinctly the Superficies of them, according to which we muſt compare them, to diſcover the Relation we ſeek: For inſtance, To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve any Queſtion which tends to the diſcovering ſome exact Relation between 4 and 16, as that 4 and 16 are even Numbers and Squares, it is ſufficient to know exactly that 4 and 16 may be divided into half without a Fraction, and that both are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Number multiplied by it ſelf, and it is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to examine what their true Magnitude is: For 'tis evident, To know the exact Relation of Quality which is between things, it is ſufficient to have a very diſtinct Idea of their Quality, without thinking any thing of their Magnitude; and that to know their exact Relations of Magnitude, it ſufficies to know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:107782:126"/>their Magnitude without enquiring after their true Quality.</p>
                        <p>It is plain in the third place, That to reſolve Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the third Kind, and to know any Relation that is almoſt exact, between two or more things, it is ſufficient to know pretty near the Superficies or ſides thereof, according to which we muſt compare them, to diſcover the approaching Relation that we ſeek, whether it be of Magnitude or Quality. For inſtance, I can evidently know that √ 8 is greater than 2, becauſe I can know very near the true Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the √ 8. But I cannot know how much the √ 8 exceeds 2, becauſe I cannot exactly know the true Magnitude of √ 8.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It is plain, That to reſolve Queſtions of the fourth kind, and diſcover their trifling and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Relations, it ſuffices to know things after a manner proportionate to the need we have of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them, to diſcover the Relations we ſeek. So that to reſolve all ſorts of Queſtions, 'tis not always neceſſary, to have very diſtinct Idea's of their Terms, or to know perfectly the things their Terms ſignifie: But it is requiſire to know them ſo much the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, as the Relations we endeavour to diſcover are more exact and in greater Number: For as we have already ſhewed, in imperfect Queſtions it is enough to have imperfect Idea's of the things that we conſider, to reſolve theſe Queſtions perfectly, or according to what they contain: And we likewiſe reſolve Queſtions very well, although we have no diſtinct Idea of the Terms which expreſs them; for when it is demanded if Fire is capable of melting Salt, hardening Dirt, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating Lead, and a thouſand other like things, we underſtand theſe Queſtions perfectly, and can very well reſolve them, although we have no diſtinct Idea of Fire, Salt, Dirt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe thoſe who make theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, would only know, if we have had any ſenſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that Fire has produced theſe Effects: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to the Diſcoveries we have made by our Senſes, we can anſwer them in ſuch a manner as may be capable of ſatisfying them.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> An Application of the other Rules to particular Queſtions.</head>
                        <p>THere are Queſtions of two ſorts, Simple and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound: The Reſolution of the firſt depends alone upon the Attention of the Mind to the clear Idea's of the Terms which expreſs them: The others cannot be reſolved but by the Compariſon of a third or many other Idea's; we cannot diſcover the unknown Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are expreſſed by the Terms of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, by immediately comparing the Idea's of theſe Terms, for they cannot be joyned or compared. We muſt therefore have one or many <hi>mean</hi> Idea's, to be able to make neceſſary Compariſons to diſcover theſe Relations; and exactly obſerve that theſe <hi>mean</hi> Idea's are clear and diſtinct, in proportion as the Relations we endeavour to diſcover are more exact and in greater Number.</p>
                        <p>This Rule is only a Conſequence of the firſt, and is of equal Importance: For if it is neceſſary to know exactly the Relations we compare, to have clear and diſtinctly Idea's of them: For the ſame reaſon it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to know well the <hi>mean</hi> Idea's by which we pretend to make theſe Compariſons; ſince we muſt diſtinctly know the Relation of Meaſure with each of the things that we meaſure, to diſcover the Relations of them. For inſtance, When we ſuffer a little light Veſſel to ſwim freely with a Loadſtone in it, if we turn towards the North Pole of this Loadſtone, another Loadſtone that we hold in our Hands, we ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſee the firſt Loadſtone retire, as if it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by ſome violent Wind. And if we deſire to know the Cauſe of this Effect.</p>
                        <p>It is plain, That to give a Reaſon for the Motion of this Loadſtone, it is not enough to know the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it has with the other; for although we ſhould
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:107782:127"/>even perfectly know all, we could not comprehend how theſe two Bodies could thruſt one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting.</p>
                        <p>We muſt therefore examine what things we know diſtinctly to be capable according to the Order of Nature of moving Bodies, ſince the Queſtion is to diſcover the Natural Cauſe of the Motion of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is certainly a Body: To that end we muſt not have recourſe to any Quality, Form, or Entity, or even of any Intelligence, that we do not clearly know to be capable of moving Bodies: For we cannot certainly know, that Intelligences are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſes of the Natural Motions of Bodies, nor even whether or no they can produce Motion.</p>
                        <p>We know evidently, That 'tis a Law of Nature that Bodies ſhould move each other when they meet. We muſt then endeavour to explain the Motion of the Loadſtone, by the means of any body which meets it. It is true, that it may be ſomething elſe beſides a Body which moves it; but if we have no diſtinct Idea of this thing, we muſt not make uſe of it as a fit <hi>Mean,</hi> to diſcover what we ſeek, nor to explain it to others. For 'tis not giving a Reaſon of an Effect, to aſcribe ſomething as a Cauſe of it which no body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives clearly: We muſt not then trouble our ſelves too much, whether there is any other Natural Cauſe of the Motion of Bodies than their Mutual Concurrence; but rather ſuppoſe that there is none, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſider what Body can meet and move this Loadſtone.</p>
                        <p>We diſcover at firſt ſight, that 'tis not the Loadſtone we hold in our Hands, ſince it does not touch that which is moved: But becauſe it is only moved at the approach of that which we hold in our Hands, and is not moved of it ſelf, we ought to conclude, That although it is not the Loadſtone in our Hands which moves it, it muſt be ſome little Bodies which proceed from it, and which are paſt by it towards the other Loadſtone.</p>
                        <p>To diſcover theſe little Bodies, we muſt not open our Eyes and look near the Loadſtone, for the Senſes
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:107782:128"/>would impoſe upon Reaſon, and it may be we ſhould judge that nothing proceeds from the Loadſtone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot ſee any thing go out from thence. 'Tis very probable we ſhould forget that we do not ſee the moſt impetuous Winds, nor many other Bodies which produce as extraordinary Effects: We muſt keep firm to this clear and moſt intelligible Mean, and carefully examine all the Effects of the Loadſtone, that we may diſcover how it can continually emit theſe little Bodies without being diminiſhed. For the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments that have been made ſhew, that theſe little Bodies that go out on one ſide, immediately enter in again at the other; and they will ſerve to explain all Difficulties that can be brought againſt the manner of reſolving this Queſtion. But it muſt be well obſerved, That we ought not to abandon this Mean, although even we could not anſwer ſome Difficulties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from our Ignorance in ſeveral things.</p>
                        <p>If we have not a Mind to examine from whence it is that Loadſtones are repelled, when we oppoſe the ſame Poles to each other; but rather the Reaſon why they approach and joyn to each other, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the North Pole of the one to the South Pole of the other, the Queſtion would be more difficult, and one way alone would not be ſufficient to reſolve it. It is not enough to know exactly the Relations that are between the Poles of theſe two Loadſtones, nor to have recourſe to the Means we have taken for the precedent Queſtion; for on the contrary, this Method ſeems to hinder the Effect whoſe Cauſe we would ſeek. Neither muſt we have recourſe to any thing that we do not clearly know to be the natural and common Cauſes of Corporeal Motions, nor deliver our ſelves from the Difficulty of the Queſtion, by a rambling and undeterminate Idea of an <hi>Occult Quality</hi> in Loadſtones, by which they attract each other; for the Mind can conceive but one Body, as having a ſufficient Power to attract another.</p>
                        <p>The Impenetrability of Bodies makes us clearly conceive, that Motion may be communicated by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion; and Experience proves plainly, that it is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:107782:128"/>communicated by this means: But there is neither Reaſon nor Experience which clearly demonſtrates the Motion of <hi>Attraction;</hi> for in the Experiments which ſeem moſt proper to prove this kind of Motion, we viſibly perceive, when we find the true and certain Cauſe, that what appears to be done by Attraction, is only perform'd by Impulſion. So that we muſt not keep to any other Communication of Motion, but that which is made by Impulſion: Since this way is certain and undoubted, and there is at leaſt ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity in the others which we cannot imagine. But although we could demonſtrate, that in things purely Corporeal there are other Principles of Motion than the meeting of Bodies; we could not reaſonably reject this, we ought even to keep to it before all others; ſince it is the moſt clear and evident, and appears ſo undoubted, that we are not afraid to affirm, it has been received by all People in all Ages.</p>
                        <p>Experience ſhews us, that a Loadſtone that ſwims freely upon the Water, draws near to one which we hold in our Hands, when we preſent different Poles; we muſt then conclude that it is puſhed towards it. But as it is not the Loadſtone we hold that puſhes that which ſwims, ſince that which ſwims draws nigh to that which we hold, and nevertheleſs that which ſwims would not be moved, if we did not preſent that to it which we hold in our Hands: It is evident, that at leaſt we muſt recur to both Methods to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this Queſtoin, if we will reſolve it by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Principle of the Communication of Motion.</p>
                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:107782:129"/>
                        <figure>
                           <figDesc>diagram representing the communication of motion in lodestones</figDesc>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The Loadſtone <hi>c</hi> draws near to the Loadſtone C: Therefore the Air which encompaſſes it puſhes it, ſince there is no other Body which can puſh it; and that is the firſt way. The Loadſtone <hi>c</hi> approaches only at the preſence of the Loadſtone C; therefore 'tis neceſſary that the Loadſtone C ſhould determine the Air to puſh the Loadſtone <hi>c;</hi> and that is the ſecond way. It is evident that both theſe ways are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary; ſo that the Difficulty is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to joyn them together, which may be done two ways, either in beginning with ſomething known in the Air which encompaſſes the Loadſtone <hi>c,</hi> or by beginning with ſomething known in the Loadſtone C.</p>
                        <p>If we would know that the parts of Air, like thoſe of all fluid bodies, are in continual Agitation, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but they ſtill ſtrike againſt the Loadſtone <hi>c</hi> which they ſurround; but becauſe they ſtrike it
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107782:129"/>equally on all ſides, they do not puſh it more on one ſide that another, whilſt there is an equal quantity of Air on both ſides. Things being thus, it is eaſie to judge that the Loadſtone C prevents there being ſo much of this Air as we ſpeak of, towards <hi>a</hi> as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>b;</hi> but that can be done only by diſperſing ſome other bodies in the ſpace which is between C and <hi>c.</hi> There muſt then ſome little bodies go out from the Loadſtones to fill this ſpace. So theſe little bodies chaſing away the Air near <hi>a,</hi> the Loadſtone <hi>c</hi> is leſs puſhed on that ſide than the other; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt approach to the Loadſtone C, ſince all bodies move to the ſide where they are leaſt puſhed.</p>
                        <p>But if the Loadſtone <hi>c</hi> had not many Pores about the Pole <hi>a,</hi> fit to receive the little bodies which go out from the Pole B of the other Loadſtone, and too ſmall to receive thoſe of Air: It is plain, that theſe little bodies being more agitated than Air, ſince they are to chaſe it from between the Loadſtones, they would puſh the Loadſtone <hi>c,</hi> and remove it from C. Thus ſince the Loadſtone <hi>c</hi> approaches to or deviates from C, when we preſent its different Poles, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conclude, that the Poles <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone <hi>c,</hi> are filled with different Pores: Otherwiſe the little bodies which are emitted from the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone C, would not freely paſs without puſhing the Loadſtone <hi>c</hi> by the ſide <hi>a,</hi> and would not be repulſed by the ſide <hi>b:</hi> What I ſay of one of the Loadſtones, muſt alſo be underſtood of the other.</p>
                        <p>It is evident, that we always learn ſomething by this way of reasoning upon clear Idea's and undoubted Principles: For we have diſcovered, that the Air which encompaſſes the Loadſtone <hi>c,</hi> was driven from between the Loadſtones by Bodies which are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually emitted from their Poles' which find free paſſage on one ſide and are ſtopt on the other. And if we would diſcover near what the Magnitude and Figure of the Pores of this Loadſtone are, through which theſe little bodies paſs, we muſt yet make other Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but they would lead us to ſubjects which we intend not to treat of. Upon theſe Queſtions we may
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:107782:130"/>conſult the Principles of M. <hi>Deſcartes:</hi> I ſhall only anſwer an Objection which immediately offers it ſelf, from whence is it that theſe little bodies cannot re-enter by the ſame Pores they came out; that beſides a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Figure, repreſenting the Spiral Chanels of a Screw, which we may ſuppoſe to be in the Pores producing this Effect, the Inflexion of the little Branches which compoſe theſe Pores, may in one Senſe obey the little Bodies which paſs a-croſs them, and in another Senſe make them rough, and ſtop their paſſage: So that we need not be too much ſurpriſed at the difference of the Poles of the Loadſtone, for this difference may be accounted for many ways; and all the difficulty is, amongſt ſeveral Cauſes to diſcover the true one.</p>
                        <p>If we had endeavoured to reſolve the Queſtion we have juſt now examined, in beginning with the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles which we ſuppoſe to be emitted from the Loadſtone C, we ſhould have found the ſame thing: And we ſhould likewiſe have diſcovered, that the Air is compoſed of an infinite Number of Particles which are in continual Agitation, for without it 'twould be impoſſible that the Loadſtone <hi>c</hi> ſhould approach to the Loadſtone C. I ſhall not ſtay to explain this, becauſe 'tis not difficult.</p>
                        <p>I will give you here a Queſtion more compound than the foregoing, in which many Rules muſt be made uſe of, 'tis demanded what can be the Natural and Mechanical Cauſe of the Motion of our Members.</p>
                        <p>The Idea of Natural Cauſe is clear and diſtinct, if we underſtand it, as I have explained it in the precedent Queſtion; but the Term of <hi>the Motion of our Members,</hi> is equivocal and confuſed; for there are many ſorts of theſe Motions, ſome of the Will, Natural and Convulſive ones. There are likewiſe different Members in Mans Body: So that according to the firſt Rule, I muſt ask of which of theſe Motions it is that they would know the Cauſe: But if the Queſtion is left indeterminate, ſo that I may make uſe of any I ſhall chuſe, I would examine the Queſtion after this manner.</p>
                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:107782:130"/>
                        <p>And firſt, conſider the Properties of theſe Motions, and becauſe I immediately diſcover, that Voluntary Motions are commonly more readily performed, than the Convulſive ones; I conclude from thence, that their Cauſe is different: Therefore I can, and ought to examine the Queſtion by Parts; for it would appear to be of too long a Diſcuſſion.</p>
                        <p>I would oblige my ſelf therefore, firſt, to conſider Voluntary Motion; and becauſe we have many Parts which concur to this Motion, I would firſt conſider the Arm, as compoſed of many Muſcles, which have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſome Action, when we lift a Weight up, or when we differently move Bodies; but I keep on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to one, ſuppoſing the reſt to be formed very near after the ſame manner. I inſtruct my ſelf of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, by the Help of ſome Book of Anatomy, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a Senſible Sight of its Fibres and Tendons, which I get ſome able Anatomiſt to diſſect for me, to whom I make all the Demands which ſhall afterwards produce in my Mind ſome Method for me to find what I ſeek.</p>
                        <p>Conſidering therefore all things attentively, I cannot doubt but the Principle of the Motion of my Arm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Contraction of the Muſcles which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. And if I have not a mind to perplex my ſelf with too many things: I may ſuppoſe, according to the common Opinion; that this Contraction is produced by the Animal Spirits which fill theſe Muſcles, and by this means ſhorten them; the whole Queſtion then, which reſpects Voluntary Motion, will be reduced, to know how the few Animal Spirits, which are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an Arm, can ſuddenly ſwell the Muſcles, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Orders of the Will, with a ſufficient Force to lift a Burden of an Hundred Weight or more.</p>
                        <p>When we conſider this with any Application, the firſt means that preſents it ſelf to the Imagination, is commonly that of ſome violent and quick Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, like to that of Gunpowder, or certain Liquors fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Volatile Salt, when they are mixed with thoſe that are Acid, or full of fixt Salt. A little Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, when lighted, is capable of raiſing not only
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107782:131"/>an Hundred Pound Weight, but a Tower, and even a Mountain: Earthquakes, which overthrow Towns, and ſhake whole Provinces, are alſo produced by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are kindled under Ground, much like Gunpowder. Thus, ſuppoſing in the Arm ſuch a Cauſe of the Fermentation and Dilatation of Spirits; we may ſay, that it is the Principle of the Power that Men have to perform ſuch quick and violent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>However, as we ought to diſtruſt this means, which enters into the Mind only by the Senſes, and whereof we have no clear and evident Knowledge; we muſt not too eaſily admit of it: For indeed, it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to give a Reaſon of the Force and Quickneſs of our Motions by a Compariſon, ſince this Reaſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and imperfect: For we muſt here explain a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Motion, and Fermentation is not Voluntary. The Blood exceſſively ferments in Feavers, and we cannot prevent it. The Spirits are inflamed and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in the Brain, and their Agitation diminiſhes not according to our Deſires. When a Man moves his Arm after diverſe Ways, according to this Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he muſt make a Million of great and ſmall, quick and ſlow Fermentations that begin (and which is ſtill more difficult to explain according to this Suppoſition) that end in the ſame Moment he wills it. Theſe Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations muſt not diſſipate all their Matter, and this Matter muſt be always ready to take Fire. When a Man walks Ten Miles, how many Thouſand Times muſt the Muſcles, which he uſes in walking, be filled and emptied? And what a vaſt Quantity of Spirits would be required if Fermentation ſhould diſſipate and deſtroy them at every Step. This Reaſon is therefore imperfect, to explain the Motions of our Bodies which entirely depend upon our Will.</p>
                        <p>It is evident, that the preſent Queſtion conſiſts in this Mechanical Problem. <hi>By Pneumatick Machines, to find the means of overcoming ſuch or ſuch Force, ſuppoſe a Hundred Weight, by another as ſmall as we will, ſuppoſe the Weight of an Ounce; and that the Application of this little Force ſhall produce its deſired Effect, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107782:131"/>the Will.</hi> Now this Problem is eaſily reſolved, and the Demonſtration of it is clear.</p>
                        <p>We may reſolve it by a Veſſel which has two Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, one of which is a little more than 1600. Times greater than the other, in which let there be inſerted the Tubes of two equal Bellows, and only apply a Force 1600 Times greater than the other, to the Mouth of the greater Bellows; for then the Force of 1600 Times the leſs, ſhall overcome the greater. The Demonſtration of it is clear from <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> ſince the Powers are not exactly in Reciprocal Proportion with the Orifices, and the Relation of the leaſt Force to the leaſt Orifice, is greater than the Relation of greater Force to the greater Orifice.</p>
                        <p>But to reſolve this Problem by a Machine which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Effect of the Muſcles, better than this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance already mentioned. Blow up a Foot-ball and let there be a great Stone of 5 or 6 Hundred Weight laid upon it when half filled with Wind, or place the Ball upon a Table with a Board over it, and a Stone over that, or let ſome heavy Man ſit upon it, holding himſelf by ſomething that he may be able to reſiſt the ſwelling of the Foot-ball. For if one blow in the Foot-ball once only with his Mouth, it will raiſe up the Stone, which preſſes it down, or the Man who ſits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; provide a the Orifice, by which the Wind enters the Foot-ball, have a Sucker to hinder it from going out whilſt the Perſon takes Breath. The Reaſon of this is, that the Orifice in the Ball is ſo ſmall, or ought to be ſuppoſed ſo ſmall, in Relation to the whole Ball which is compreſſed by the Stone, that a ſmall Force is capable to overpower a great one by this method.</p>
                        <p>If we conſider alſo, that ones Breath is capable of puſhing a Ball of Lead very violently by the means of a long Tube, becauſe the Force of the Breath diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates not, but continually renews: we may viſibly diſcover, that the neceſſary Proportion between the Orifice and Capacity of the Ball, being ſuppoſed, ones Breath only may eaſily overcome a very great Force.</p>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:107782:132"/>
                        <p>If then we conceive, that all the Muſcles, or each of the Fibres which compoſe them, have like this Foot-ball, a Capacity fit to receive the Animal Spirits; that the Pores, by which the Spirits inſinuate themſelves, are ſtill ſmaller in Proportion than the Neck of a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Orifice of a Ball; that the Spirits are kept in, and puſhed forward in the Nerves, like Air in Tubes, and that the Spirits are more agitated than the Breath of the Lungs, and puſhed with more Force in the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, than in Balls: We ſhall diſcover, that the Motion of the Spirits, which are diſperſed through the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, can overcome the Force of the moſt weighty Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens we can bear; and that if we cannot carry the heavieſt, the Defect of the Power proceeds not ſo much from the Spirits, as that of the Fibres and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes that compoſe the Muſcles, which would break if we made too great an Effort. Beſides, if we obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that by the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, the Motions of theſe Spirits, as to their Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, depend upon the Will of Man, we ſhould plainly ſee that the Motions of the Arms muſt be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</p>
                        <p>It is true, we remove our Arms with ſo much Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that at firſt it ſeems incredible, that the Effuſion of the Spirits in the Muſcles which compoſe them, ſhould be quick enough to produce ſuch a Motion. But we muſt conſider, that theſe Spirits are extreamly agitated, always ready to go from one Muſcle to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that there is not need of many to ſwell them up ſo little as is neceſſary, to move them only, or when we lift any thing that's very light from the Ground; for when we have any thing heavy to lift we cannot do it ſo ſpeedily. Burthens being heavy, will much ſwell and ſtretch the Muſcles. To ſwell them up after this manner, requires more Spirits than there is in the adjoyning or oppoſite Muſcles. There muſt therefore be ſome little Time to collect theſe Spirits, in a Quantity ſufficient to reſiſt this Weight: So that thoſe which are laden cannot run, and thoſe that take any weighty thing from the Ground, cannot do it with ſo much Haſte as thoſe who take up a Straw.</p>
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:107782:132"/>
                        <p>If we further reflect, that thoſe that have more Heat, or a little Wine in their Heads, are much quicker than others; as amongſt Animals, thoſe whoſe Spirits are more agitated, as Birds move more ſwiftly than they that have their Blood cold, like Frogs: And that even amongſt them there are ſome, as the Camelion, the Tortoiſe, and other Infects, whoſe Spirits are ſo little agitated, that their Muſcles fill not faſter than a little Foot-ball which we ſhould blow up. If we well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all theſe things, it may be, we might think the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation already given fit to be received.</p>
                        <p>But although this Part of the propoſed Queſtion which regards Voluntary Motions, is ſufficiently reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: We muſt not however, affirm that it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, and that there is nothing more in our Bodies, which contributes to theſe Motions, than what we have attributed to it; for there is probably in our Muſcles, a thouſand Springs which facilitate theſe Motions, and will be eternally unknown to thoſe, even who make the ſtricteſt Scrutinies into the Works of God.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Part of the Queſtion which muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, reſpects Natural Motions, or thoſe ſort of Motions which have nothing extraordinary, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive have; but that are abſolutely neceſſary to the Preſervation of our Machine, which conſequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not entirely upon our Wills.</p>
                        <p>I conſider then firſt, with all the Attention I am ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, what the Motions are which have theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and if they are wholly alike; but becauſe I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſcover, that almoſt all of them differ one from another, not to perplex my ſelf with too many things, I only inſiſt upon the Motion of the Heart. This Part is the moſt known, and its Motions moſt ſenſible. I then examine its Structure, and amongſt many others, obſerve two things. The firſt, that 'tis compoſed of Fibres like other Muſcles; the ſecond, that there is two very conſiderable Cavities in it. I therefore judge, that its Motions may be performed by the Animal Spirits, becauſe it is a Muſcle, and that the Blood there ferments and dilates its ſelf, ſince there
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:107782:133"/>are Cavities there. The firſt of theſe Determinations is founded upon what I have already ſaid; and the ſecond, becauſe the Heart is much hotter than all the other Parts of the Body; as it is that which diſperſes Heat with the Blood into all our Members, that theſe two Cavities could neither have been formed nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferved, but only by the Dilatation of the Blood; and that thus they are ſerviceable to the Cauſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them. I can then give a ſufficient Reaſon for the Motion of the Heart, by the Spirits which agitate it, and the Blood which dilates it when this Blood is fermented: For although the Cauſe I bring for its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould not perhaps be true, yet it appears cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to me, that it is ſufficient to produce it.</p>
                        <p>It's true, that the Principle of the Fermentation or Dilatation of the Liquors, probably is not enough known to all that ſhall read this Book, to pretend to have ſhewn an Effect, when we have in general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that its Cauſe is Fermentation; but we muſt not reſolve all particular Queſtions by going back unto the firſt Cauſes. It is not becauſe we cannot by this demonſtrate, and diſcover the true Syſtem upon which all particular Effects depend, provided we ſtop only at clear Idea's: But that this manner of Philoſophizing is neither the moſt exact nor ſhorteſt.</p>
                        <p>To explain what I mean, we muſt know there are Queſtions of two Sorts. In the firſt we try to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Nature and Properties of ſomething: In the others we only deſire to know if ſuch a thing hath, or hath not ſuch a Propriety, or if we know it has ſuch a Propriety, we would only know the Cauſe of it.</p>
                        <p>To reſolve Queſtions of the firſt Kind, we muſt conſider things in their Original, and always conceive them produced by the moſt Simple and moſt Natural Ways. To reſolve the reſt, a very different manner muſt be taken: They muſt be done by Suppoſitions, and we muſt examine whether theſe Suppoſitions make us guilty of any Abſurdity, or if they conduce to any Truth clearly known.</p>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:107782:133"/>
                        <p>For Inſtance, we would diſcover what are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Cycloid, or of ſome of the <hi>Conick Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> Theſe Lines muſt be conſidered in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and formed according to the moſt Simple and leaſt perplext Ways; for 'tis the beſt and ſhorteſt Method to diſcover the Nature and Properties of them. We eaſily ſee that the Subtenſe of the Cycloid is equal to the Circle which forms it; and if we do not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover many Properties by this means, 'tis becauſe the Circular Line which ſerves to form it, is not ſufficiently known. But for theſe Lines, purely Mathematical, or ſuch whoſe Relations we can know more exactly, as Conick Sections, we may diſcover a great Number of their Properties, by conſidering them in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. We muſt only obſerve, that as they may be generated by a Regular Motion ſeveral Ways; ſo all Sorts of Generations are not equally proper to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Mind, but the moſt Simple are the beſt; and that it often happens, that certain particular Methods are more proper than others, to demonſtrate ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Properties.</p>
                        <p>But if the Queſtion is not in general to diſcover the Properties of a thing, but to know if a thing has ſuch a Property: Then it muſt be ſuppoſed that it hath it effectively, and examine attentively, what muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Suppoſition; whether it leads to a manifeſt Abſurdity, or elſe to ſome undoubted Truth, which may ſerve as a means to diſcover what we enquire after. And 'tis that Method Geometricians make uſe of to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve their Problems. They ſuppoſe as done, what they ſeek for, and examine what muſt happen from thence, and attentively conſider the Relations which reſult from their Suppoſitions. They repreſent all theſe Relations which include the Condition of the Problem by <hi>Equations;</hi> and afterwards reduce theſe <hi>Equations,</hi> according to their Rules, ſo that what is unknown, they find equal to one or many things perfectly known.</p>
                        <p>If the Queſtion then is in general, to diſcover the Nature of Fire, and the different Fermentations, which are the moſt univerſal Cauſes of Natural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107782:134"/>I ſay, that the ſhorteſt and moſt ſecure Way, is to examine it in its Original. We muſt conſider the Formation of the moſt agitated Body, the Motion of which is diſperſed into thoſe that ferment. By clear Idea's, and the moſt Simple Way, we muſt examine what Motion is capable of producing in Matter. And becauſe Fire and different Fermentations are very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral things, and which conſequently depend upon few Cauſes; it will not be requiſite long to conſider what Matter is capable of when it is animated by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to diſcover the Nature of Fermentation is its Principle; and at the ſame time we ſhall learn many other things abſolutely neceſſary to the Knowledge of Phyſicks: Whereas if in this Queſtion, we would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by Suppoſitions, we ſhould go back to the firſt Cauſes, to the Laws of Nature, according to which all things are formed; and ſuppoſe many falſe things, which would be of no Uſe.</p>
                        <p>We might ſoon diſcover, that the Cauſe of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is the Motion of an Inviſible Matter, which communicates its ſelf to the Parts of that which acts it; for we know plain enought, that Fire, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Fermentation of Bodies, conſiſt in their Agitation, and that by the Laws of Nature. Bodies immediately receive their Motion only by their meeting with ſome others more agitated. Thus we may diſcover, that there is an Inviſible Matter, whoſe Agitation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Viſible Bodies. But it would be Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible, by way of Suppoſition, to diſcover how it is done: And it is not near ſo difficult to diſcover, when we examine the Formation of the Elements, or ſome Bodies, whereof there's a great Number of the ſame Nature, as is evident by Mr. <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Syſtem.</p>
                        <p>The third Part of the Queſtion, which is of Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Motions will not be very difficult to reſolve, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we ſuppoſe in Bodies Animal Spirits, capable of ſome Fermentation, and of Humours ſufficiently pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, to inſinuate themſelves into the Pores of the Nerves, by which the Spirits diſperſe themſelves through the Muſcles, provided alſo we do not pretend
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:107782:134"/>to determine what the true Diſpoſition of the Inviſible Parts is, which contribute to theſe Convulſive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>When we have ſeparated a Muſcle from the reſt of the Body, and hold it by the Extremities, we Senſibly perceive that it makes all its Effort to contract it ſelf when we prick it in the Middle. It is very probable, that this depends upon the Conſtruction of the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible Parts that compoſe it, which like ſo many Springs, are determined to certain Motions by this Pricking. But who can affirm they have found the true Diſpoſition of the Parts, which ſerve to produce this Motion; or who can give an undoubted Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it? Certainly it would appear impoſſible, although it may be through the Power of Thought, we can imagine a Conſtruction of the Muſcles, fit to perform all the Motions we ſee them capable of. Yet muſt we not think to determine what is the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Muſcles: But becauſe we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably doubt, that there are Spirits Suſceptible of ſome Fermentation, by the Mixture of ſome Subtle Matter, and that the ſharp and pungent Humours may inſinuate themſelves into the Nerves, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it.</p>
                        <p>To reſolve the Queſtion propoſed, we muſt firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine how many Sorts of Convulſive Motions there are; and becauſe the Number of them appears inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, we may keep to the chief, whoſe Cauſes ſeem to be different. We muſt conſider the Parts wherein they are performed, the Diſeaſes which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede and follow them: If they are produced with or without Pain, and particularly how quick and violent they are; for ſome of them are performed very quick and violent, others with Quickneſs without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſome again without Quickneſs or Violence. There are ſome of them which continually end and being again; ſome which keep the Parts ſtiff and without Motion for ſome Time; and ſome again which entirely take away Perſons Senſes, and dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure them.</p>
                        <pb n="274" facs="tcp:107782:135"/>
                        <p>All theſe things conſidered, 'tis not difficult in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to explain, how the Convulſive Motions may be produced, after what we have already ſaid of Natural and Voluntary Motions. For if we conceive that there is ſome Matter capable of fermenting the Spirits, mixed with thoſe that are contained in a Muſcle; this Muſcle will be ſwelled up, and ſhall in this part produce a Convulſive Motion.</p>
                        <p>If we can eaſily reſiſt this Motion, it will be a ſign that the Nerves are not ſtopt by any Humour, ſince we can empty the Muſcle of the Spirits which are entred there, and determine them to ſwell up the oppoſite Muſcle. But if we cannot, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the ſharp and penetrating Humours have at leaſt ſome ſhare in this Motion. It may even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen, that theſe Humours are the ſole Cauſe of theſe Convulſive Motions: So they may determine the Courſe of the Spirits to certain Muſeles, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſſages which carry them thither, and ſhutting up ſome others: Beſides, they may contract the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and Fibers, by penetrating their Pores.</p>
                        <p>When a very heavy Weight hangs at the bottom of a Cord, we can raiſe it much, if we only wet the Cord; becauſe the Particles of Water inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like ſo many little Wedges between the Threads that the Cord is compoſed of, and ſhorten it by making it thicker. So the penetrating and ſharp Humours inſinuate themſelves into the Pores of the Nerves, contract them, ſtretch the parts which are united to them, and produce Convulſive Motions in the Body, which are extream ſlow, violent and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and often for ſome conſiderable time, leave a very great Diſtortion in the Part.</p>
                        <p>For the Convulſive Motions which are ſpeedily performed, they are cauſed by the Spirits; but 'tis not neceſſary that theſe Spirits ſhould receive any Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; it is enough if the Conduits they paſs through are more open on one ſide than the other.</p>
                        <p>When all the parts of the Body are in their Natural Situation, the Animal Spirits equally and ſwiftly diſperſe themſelves every where in reſpect to the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:107782:135"/>Exigency of the Machine, and Faithfully execute the Orders of the Will. But when the Humours trouble the Diſpoſition of the Brain, and change or diverſly move the Openings of the Nerves, or by penetrating into the Muſcles, agitate their Springs; the Spirits diſperſe themſelves through the Parts after new manner, and produce extraordinary Motions there without the conſent of the Will.</p>
                        <p>Yet may we ſometimes by a powerful Reſiſtance prevent any of theſe Motions, and even by degrees diminiſh the Traces which produced them, when the Habit is perfectly formed. Thoſe who take care of them, may very eaſily hinder themſelves from making diſtorted Faces; or from aſſuming an unpleaſant Air or indecent Poſture, if the Body be indiſpoſed. Theſe things may be overcome although they are confirmed by a long habit, but with much difficulty; for they ſhould alwayes be reſiſted in their original, before the courſe of the Spirits has made a way too difficult to be ſtopt.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſe of theſe Motions lies ſometimes in the agitated Muſcle, and is ſome Humour that pricks, or ſome Spirits which ferment there. But we muſt judge it to be in the Brain, chiefly when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions agitate not only one or two parts of the Body in particular, but almoſt all of it; and that in many Diſtempers which change the Natural Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Blood and Spirits.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that one Nerve only having ſometimes different Branches, which are ſufficiently diſperſed through the remote parts of the Body, as through the Face and Bowels; it often happens that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion having its Cauſe in one part, in which ſome of theſe Branches inſinuate themſelves, can commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it ſelf to them, or the other correſpondent Branches, without the Brains being any cauſe of it, or the Spirits corrupted.</p>
                        <p>But when the Convulſive Motions are common to moſt parts of the Body, we muſt needs ſay, that either the Spirits ferment after an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or that the Order and Diſpoſition of the parts of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:107782:136"/>the Brain is troubled; or elſe, that both theſe things happen together. I will ſtay no longer upon this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, for it becomes ſo compounded, and depends upon ſo many things, when we deſecend to Particulars, that it cannot eaſily ferve to explain thoſe Rules we have given.</p>
                        <p>There is no Science which furniſhes us with more Examples, fit to ſhew the Uſefulneſs of theſe Rules, than Geometry and chiefly Algebra, for in theſe two Sciences they are continually uſed. Geometry clearly ſhews the neceſſity there always is of beginning with the moſt ſimple things, which include the feweſet Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: If always examines theſe Relations by Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures evidently known: It takes away whatever is uſeleſs in the diſcovery of them, divides the Queſtions into parts, ranks theſe parts, and examines them in order. In ſhort, The only Defect in this Science, is as I have before obſerved, that it has not a very proper Method to abridge the Idea's and Relations we have diſcovered. So that although it regulates the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and makes the Mind become exact, it does not much increaſe its Extenſion, nor render it capable of diſcovering very compound Truths. But Algebra continually teaches us to abridge Idea's and their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, after the ſhorteſt Method in the World, and extreamly augments the Capacity of the Mind; for we can conceive nothing, how Compound ſoever, in the Relations of Magnitude, that the Mind cannot in times diſcover by its aſſiſtance, when we once know the way we muſt take.</p>
                        <p>The fifth and following Rules, which concern the way of abridging Idea's, only reſpect this Science; for in other Sciences we have no commodious way of abridging them; ſo that I ſhall not ſtay to explain them. Thoſe that have a great Inclination for the Mathematicks, and will give to their Mind all the Force and Extenſion it is capable of; and thus put themſelves into a Condition of diſcovering, without a Tutor, an infinite number of known Truths, will, if they ſeriouſly apply themſelves to Algebra, diſcover, that this Science is ſo uſeful in an Enquiry after
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107782:136"/>Truth, becauſe it obſerves the Rules we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. But by Algebra, I mean chiefly that which <hi>Deſcartes</hi> and ſome others have made uſe of.</p>
                        <p>Before I conclude, I will give an Example on which I ſhall inſiſt a little longer, that we may be the better able to ſee what uſe may be drawn from it. In this Example I will repreſent the Advances of a Mind, which would examine a very important Queſtion, and endeavour to deliver it ſelf from its Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. I ſhall at firſt make it fall into ſome Error, that it may recollect what I have ſaid elſewhere; now its Attention at laſt conducting it to the Truth enquired after, I make it ſpeak poſitively, like one who pretends to have reſolved the Queſtion he has examined.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The laſt Example to ſhew the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of this Work, in which the Cauſe of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Parts of Bodies, and alſo the Rules of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Motion, are examined.</head>
                        <p>BOdies are united together after three different ways, by <hi>Continuity, Contiguity,</hi> and a third way, which has no particular name, becauſe it rarely happens, and which I call by the general Term of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By <hi>Continuity,</hi> or the Cauſe of it, I mean that <hi>I know not what,</hi> which links together the Parts of a Body ſo ſtrongly, that they cannot eaſily be ſeparated, and which we look upon as making altogether but one whole.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>Contiguity,</hi> I mean that <hi>I know not what,</hi> which makes me ſuppoſe two Bodies touching after ſuch a manner ſo that there is nothing between them; but which I judge not ſtrictly united, becauſe I can eaſily ſeparate them.</p>
                        <pb n="278" facs="tcp:107782:137"/>
                        <p>By this third Term <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> I mean <hi>that I know not what,</hi> which is the cauſe that wo Glaſſes, or two Marbles, whoſe Surfaces having been poliſhed by rubbing one againſt another, are joyned together in ſuch a manner, that although we can very eaſily ſeparate them by making them ſlip off one another, we ſhall never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs have ſome trouble to do it by any other Method.</p>
                        <p>Now this is not <hi>Continuity,</hi> ſince theſe two Glaſſes or Marbles being united after this manner, are not conceived as making but one Body, becauſe in one Senſe we can ſeparate them ſo eaſily. Nor is it ſimply <hi>Contiguity,</hi> although it comes very near it, becauſe theſe two pieces of Glaſs or Marble are ſtrictly enough united, and even much more than the Parts of ſoft and liquid Bodies, as thoſe of Butter and Water.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Terms thus explained, we muſt afterwards enquire into the Cauſe which unites Bodies, and the Differences between <hi>Continuity, Contiguity,</hi> and the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of Bodies, according to the Senſe I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. I firſt ſeek the Cauſe of <hi>Continuity,</hi> or that <hi>I know not what,</hi> which keeps the Parts of a Body ſo ſtrictly united together, that ſome Force muſt be uſed to ſeparate them, and which we look upon together as making one whole. I hope this Cauſe being found, we ſhall have no great Difficulty to diſcover the reſt.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems now neceſſary to me, that this <hi>I know not what,</hi> that ties even the ſmalleſt Parts of a piece of Iron together which I hold in my Hand, ſhould be ſomething very powerful, ſince I muſt uſe a great Force to break off one little part of it. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſelf, May not this Difficulty that I find in breaking the leaſt piece of Iron, proceed from my Weakneſs, and not the reſiſtance of the Iron? For I remember that I have formerly uſed more Violence than I do now, to break a piece of Iron like that I hold in my Hand; and if I fall Sick, perhaps I could not even do it by the utmoſt Power I could uſe. I therefore ſee plainly, I muſt not abſolutely judge of Firmneſs, whereby the parts of Iron are knit together,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:107782:137"/>by the Endeavours I make to diſ-unite them: I muſt only judge that they keep very ſtrongly together in relation to my Weakneſs, or that they keep more ſtrongly together than the parts of my Fleſh, ſince the Senſations of Pain that I have whilſt I make too great Efforts, advertiſes me that I ſhall rather diſ-unite the parts of my Body than thoſe of Iron.</p>
                        <p>I diſcover then, that as I am not abſolutely Strong, or Weak, Iron or other Bodies, are not abſolutely hard or flexible, but only in relation to the Cauſe which acts upon them; and that the Efforts I make cannot ſerve me as a Rule to meaſure the greatneſs of the Force, that muſt be imployed to overcome the Reſiſtance and Hardneſs of Iron. For Rules ought to be invariable, and theſe Efforts change according to time, the abundance of actual Spirits, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Fleſh; ſince I cannot always produce the ſame Effects, by uſing the ſame Endeavours.</p>
                        <p>This Reflection delivers me from a Prejudice that I had, which made me imagine the Links were ſtrong which united the parts of Bodies, which Links per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are nothing at all; and I hope it will not be uſeleſs to me in the Conſequence; for I have a ſtrange Inclination to judge of every thing in relation to my ſelf, and to follow the Impreſſions of my Senſes, which I would more induſtriouſly avoid. But to proceed.</p>
                        <p>After having thought ſome time, and with ſome application enquired the cauſe of this ſtrict Union, without having diſcovered any thing of it, I find my ſelf carried by my Negligence and Nature to judge with many others, that 'tis the Form of Bodies which preſerves the Union between their Parts, or the Amity and Inclination they have for their likeneſs; for there is nothing more commodious than to ſuffer our ſelves ſometimes to be ſeduced, and ſo to become Learned at little Coſt.</p>
                        <p>But ſince I will not believe any thing I do not know, I muſt not ſuffer my ſelf to be thus overcome by my own Idleneſs, nor give my ſelf up to bare Appearances. Let us quit therefore theſe Forms and Inclinations,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:107782:138"/>whereof we have no diſtinct and particular Idea's, but only confuſed and general ones, that it may be we form only in relation to our Nature, and even in the Exiſtence of which many Perſons, and perhaps whole Nations agree not.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems to me, that I ſee the Cauſe of this ſtrict Union of Parts which compoſe hard Bodies, without admitting of any other thing than what all the World grants to be in them, or at leaſt all that the World conceives diſtinctly to be there; for every one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly conceives, that all Bodies are or may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of little Particles. Thus it may be there are ſome of them which are crooked and branched, and like little Links capable of holding others ſtrongly together, or elſe that they intermix all their Branches, ſo that we cannot eaſily diſ-unite them.</p>
                        <p>I have a great Mind to permit my ſelf to eſpouſe this Thought, and ſo much the more, as that I ſee the viſible Parts of great Bodies hold and unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together after this manner. But I cannot too much diſtruſt my Prejudices and the Impreſſion of my Senſes: I muſt therefore yet examine the Matter more cloſely, and ſee the Reaſon why the ſmalleſt and utmoſt Parts of Solid Bodies, in a word, even the Parts of each of theſe Links hold together; for they cannot be united by other Links yet ſmaller, ſince <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe them ſolid: Or elſe, If I ſay they are united after this manner, they may reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what ſhall unite theſe others together, and ſo on <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="281" facs="tcp:107782:138"/>
                        <figure>
                           <figDesc>diagram representing presumed atomic links</figDesc>
                        </figure>
                        <p>So that now the Difficulty of the Queſtion is to know, how the parts of theſe little Links, or branched parts, can be ſo ſtrictly united together as they are, A for inſtance with B, which I ſuppoſe parts of a little Link. Or elſe, which is the ſame thing, Bodies being ſo much the harder, as they are more ſolid, and have fewer Pores, the Queſtion now is, to know how the parts of a Column, compoſed of a Matter which has no Pore, can be ſtrongly joyned together, and compoſe a very hard Body; for we cannot ſay that the parts of this Column is held by little Links, ſince being without Pores they have no particular Figure.</p>
                        <p>I find my ſelf yet extreamly inclined to ſay, that this Column is naturally hard, or elſe that the little Links, whereof hard Bodies are compoſed, are Atoms, whoſe parts cannot be divided, as being the eſſential and utmoſt parts of Bodies, which are eſſentially crooked, or branched, or of ſome perplex'd Figure.</p>
                        <p>But I freely confeſs that this is not to explain the Difficulty, and that quitting the Prejudices and Illuſions of my Senſes, I ſhould be in the wrong to recur to an abſtracted Form, and embrace a Logical
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:107782:139"/>Phantom for the cauſe I ſeek: I mean, I ſhould be in the wrong, to conceive as ſomething real and diſtinct, a rambling Idea of the Nature of Eſſence, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes only what we know: And thus to take an abſtracted and univerſal Form, as a Phyſical Cauſe of a real Effect. For there are two things which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not too much diſtruſt; the firſt is, The Impreſſion of my Senſes; and the other, The Facility I have to receive abſtracted Natures, and general Logical Idea's, for thoſe which are Real and Particular: I remember I have been many times ſeduced by theſe two Principal Errors.</p>
                        <p>But to return to the Difficulty, It is not poſſible for me to conceive, how theſe little Links ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible by their Nature and Eſſence, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently how they ſhould be Inflexible; ſince on the contrary I conceive them very Diviſible, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily diviſible by their Nature and Eſſence: For the part A is moſt certainly a Subſtance as well as B; and conſequently it is clear, that A can exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out B, ſince Subſtances can exiſt one without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe otherwiſe they would not be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                        <p>We cannot ſay that A is not a Subſtance; for it is plain it is not a bare Mode, and all Beings are either Modes or Subſtances. So ſince A is not a Mode 'tis a Subſtance, then it may exiſt without B, and much more may the part A exiſt ſeparately from B. So that this Link is diviſible in A and in B.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, If this Link was Indiviſible, or crooked by Nature and Eſſence, it would be quite contrary to what we Experience, for then we could not break any body. Let us ſuppoſe as before, that a piece of Iron is compoſed of many Links, which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd one in another, whereof A, <hi>a</hi> and B, <hi>b,</hi> are two of them: I ſay that we cannot unlink them, and conſequently that we could not break this Iron: For to break it, we muſt bend the Links that compoſe it, which are nevertheleſs ſuppoſed naturally and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially inflexible.</p>
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:107782:139"/>
                        <p>And if we do not ſuppoſe them inflexible, but only indiviſible by their Nature, the Suppoſition will be of no uſe to reſolve the Queſtion: For then the Difficulty would be to know, why theſe little Links do not obey our Efforts when we try to bend a Bar of Iron. Yet if we ſuppoſe them not Inflexible, we muſt not ſuppoſe them Indiviſible; for if the parts of theſe Links can change their Situation one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to another, it is plain that they may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; ſince there is no reaſon why, if one part could remove it ſelf a little from the other, it could not be abſolutely done. Then whether we ſuppoſe theſe Links Inflexible or Indiviſible, we cannot by this means reſolve the Queſtion: For if we ſuppoſe them only Indiviſible, we muſt without trouble break a bit of Iron: And if we ſuppoſe them Inflexible, it will be impoſſible to break them, ſince the little Links which compoſe the Iron being embarraſſed one in another, it will be impoſſible to unlink them. Let us try then to reſolve the Difficulty by clear and undoubted Principles, and to find the reaſon why this little Link hath theſe two parts A and B, ſo firmly united.</p>
                        <p>I ſee evidently that it is neceſſary to divide the Subject of my Meditation into parts, that I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it more exactly, and with leſs Intention of Mind, ſince I have not been able immediately with one ſimple view, and all the Attention I am capable of, to diſcover what I would find. And 'tis what I might have done from the beginning; for when the Subjects that we conſider are a little intricate, 'tis alwayes the beſt way to examine them in parts, and not fatigue our ſelves unuſefully upon falſe Hopes of meeting luckily with the Truth.</p>
                        <p>What I enquire after, is the cauſe of the ſtrict Union that is between the little Particles which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Link A B. Now there is only three things that I diſtinctly conceive capable of being the cauſe which I ſeek, <hi>viz.</hi> The parts of this little Link, the Will of the Author of Nature, or laſtly, the Inviſible Bodies which ſurround theſe little Links. I might yet
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:107782:140"/>bring for the Cauſe of theſe things, the Form of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Qualities of Hardneſs, or ſome occult one, the Simpathy which would be between the Particles of the ſame kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but becauſe I have not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Idea of theſe fine things, I neither ought, nor can maintain my Arguments from them; ſo that if I find not the Cauſe I ſeek, in things that I have a diſtinct Idea of; I will not uſeleſſy fatigue my ſelf in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of theſe rambling and general Logical Idea's, and will ceaſe from ſpeaking of what I underſtand not. But let us examine the firſt of theſe things, which may be the Cauſe, how the Particles of this little Link are ſo ſtrictly united, <hi>viz.</hi> the little Parts it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of.</p>
                        <p>When I conſider only the Parts whereof hare Bodies are compoſed, I find my ſelf inclined to believe, <hi>That we cannot imagine any Cement which unites the Parts of this Link, beſides themſelves and their own Reſt: For of what Nature could it be? It would not be a thing which ſubſiſts of it ſelf, for all theſe little Particles being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for what Reaſon ſhould they be united by other Subſtances than by themſelves? Neither will it be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Quality from Reſt, becauſe there is no Quality more contrary to Motion which might ſeparate theſe Parts, than Reſt: But beſides Subſtances and their Qualities, we know of no other kind of Beings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is very true,<note place="margin">Defc. <hi>Prin.</hi> 1. <hi>Art</hi> 55.<hi>p</hi> 2.</note> the Parts of hard Bodies continue united, whilſt they are in Reſt one with another; and when they are once in Reſt, they continue ſo of themſelves as long as they can. But this is not what I ſeek, I know not how I came to miſtake the Subject, I endeavour here to diſcover why the Particles of hard Bodies have Power to continue in Reſt one by another, and how they reſiſt the Efforts we make to move them.</p>
                        <p>I might then anſwer my ſelf,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> Princip. Article <hi>43.</hi> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part.</note> that each Body has truly a Power to continue in the State 'tis in, and that this Power is equal, either in reſpect to Motion or Reſt: But that which makes the Parts of hard Bodies continue in Reſt by one anotherd, ſo that we are troubled to ſeparate and move them, is becauſe we
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:107782:140"/>employ not Motion enough to conquer their Reſt. This is probable, it is true, but I ſeek a Certainty, if it can be found, and not only a Probability.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Articl.</hi> 63.</note> And how can I certainly and evidently know that each Body has this Power to continue in the Condition it is in, and that this Power is equal in reſpect to Motion and Reſt; ſince on the contrary, Matter appears indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to Motion and Reſt, and abſolutely without any Power. Let us have Recourſe then with Mr. <hi>Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> to the Will of the Creator, which is it may be, the Power that Bodies ſeem to have in themſelves; 'tis the ſecond thing that we before ſuppoſed, was able to preſerve the Parts of this little Link we ſpeak of, ſo ſtrongly united.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, 'tis impoſſible that God may will each Body to continue in the Condition it is in, and that his Will is the Power which unites the Parts one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after the ſame manner as I have elſewhere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered his Will to be the moving Power which puts Bodies in Motion: For ſince Matter cannot move of it ſelf, it ſeems to me, that I muſt judge it to be a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and even that 'tis the Author of Nature who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it and puts it in Motion, by ſucceſſively preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in many Places by his Simple Will, ſince a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, infinitely powerful, acts not by Inſtruments, and the Effects neceſſarily follow his Will.</p>
                        <p>I perceive then,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> Art. <hi>33.</hi> of the <hi>2d</hi> Part. Art:. <hi>45.</hi> and in thoſe which follow.</note> 'tis poſſible that God ſhould keep every thing in the Condition it is in, whether it be in Reſt or in Motion, and that his Will is the Natural Power that Bodies have to continue in the State in which they have once been placed. If it is ſo, we muſt, as <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has done, meaſure this Power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what ought to be the Natural Effects of it, and thus give Rules for the Power and Communication of Motions, at the Concourſe of different Bodies, by the Proportion of Magnitude that is found between theſe Bodies; ſince we have no other Way to diſcover this general and immurable Will of God, who cauſes the different Powers that Bodies have to act upon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt one another, beſides their different Magnitudes and Celerities.</p>
                        <pb n="286" facs="tcp:107782:141"/>
                        <p>Yet, I have no certain Proof, that by a poſitive Will, God keeps Bodies in a State of Reſt; and it ſeems ſufficient for him to will the Exiſtence of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not only to cauſe it to exiſt, but to remain in Reſt.</p>
                        <p>It is not the ſame in reſpect to Motion, becauſe the Idea of Matter moved, certainly includes two Powers to which it relates, <hi>viz.</hi> That which created it, and that which moves it. But the Idea of Matter in Reſt only includes the Idea of a Creating Power, without a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of one to keep it in Reſt; ſince if we ſimply conceive Matter, without thinking of any Power, we ſhall neceſſarily conceive it in Reſt. Thus 'tis I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine things, for I muſt judge of them according to my Idea's, and according to them, Reſt is but a Privation of Motion: For 'tis ſufficient for God to ceaſe to will that a Body ſhould he moved, for its Motion to ceaſe, and cauſe it to remain in Reſt.</p>
                        <p>But I remember I have heard many Ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſay, that it appeared to them, that Motion was as well the Privation of Reſt, as that Reſt was a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Motion. Some even have aſſured me, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I could not apprehend, that it was more probable that Motion was rather a Privation than Reſt. I do not diſtinctly remember the Arguments they brought, but it ought to make me ſuſpect my Idea's to be falſe. For although moſt Men ſpeak what pleaſes them, upon Matters that do not appear very Important: Yet, I have Reaſon to believe, that the Perſons I ſpeak of, took Pleaſure in ſpeaking what they conceived. I muſt therefore ſtill examine my Idea's very carefully.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a thing which appears undoubted to me, and theſe Gentlemen I ſpeak of grant it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the Will of God which moves Bodies. The Power then that a Bowl has, which I ſee in Motion, is the Will of God which cauſes it to move: And what muſt God now do to cauſe it to ſtop? Muſt he, by a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Will determine it to be in Reſt,<note place="margin">I imagine here that there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, my ſelf, and a Bowl.</note> or elſe is it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that he ceaſes to will it ſhould be moved? It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if God only ceaſes to will that this Bowl ſhould be moved, the Ceſſation of this Will of God
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:107782:141"/>will be the Ceſſation of the Motion of the Bowl; for the Will of God, which was the Power that moved the Bowl, being no more, this Power will continue no longer, nor the Bowl therefore any more moved. Thus a Ceſſation of the Power of Motion cauſes Reſt. Reſt has therefore no Power which produces it: 'Tis then only a pure Privation, which ſuppoſes not a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Will in God; ſo that it would be unreaſonable and unneceſſary to admit a poſitive Will in God, to give Bodies any Power to continue in Reſt.</p>
                        <p>But let us, if poſſible, overthrow this Argument; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe now a Bowl in Reſt, whereas we ſuppoſed it before in Motion; what muſt God do to actuate it? Will it be enough for him to ceaſe to will it ſhould be in Reſt? If it is ſo, I have yet advanced nothing; for Motion would as well be the Privation of Reſt, as Reſt the Privation of Motion. I ſuppoſe then that God ceaſes to will it ſhould continue in Reſt, but if this be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I do not ſee that the Bowl moves; and if any one ſees it moved, I deſire them to tell me after what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Motion it is moved. Certainly 'tis impoſſible that it ſhould move, and not have ſome Degree of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and from our conceiving only that God ceaſes to will it ſhould be in Reſt, it is impoſſible to conceive it to go with any Degree of Motion; becauſe it is not the ſame with Motion as Reſt. Motions are infinitely various, they are capable of <hi>More</hi> or <hi>Leſs:</hi> But Reſt being nothing, one cannot differ from another. A Bowl even, which goes twice as faſt in one Time as in another,, has twice as much Power or Motion in one Time as in another; but we cannot ſay that the ſame Bowl has twice as much Reſt in one Time as in another.</p>
                        <p>Thefore it muſt be a poſitive Will from God, to put a Bowl in Motion, or to give a Bowl ſuch a Power as to move it ſelf; and it is enough for him to ceaſe willing its Motion, for it to be in Reſt juſt as in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World; it is not ſufficient that God ſhould will the World ſhould exiſt; but it is neceſſary that he poſitively wills the Manner in which it muſt exiſt. And to annihilate it, it muſt not be God's willing that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:107782:142"/>it ſhould not be, becauſe God cannot will nothing by a poſitive Will, it is enough only that God, ceaſes to will that it ſhould exiſt.</p>
                        <p>I do not here conſider Motion and Reſt according to their Relative Being: For 'tis plain, that Bodies in Reſt, have as real Relations to thoſe which encompaſs them, as thoſe that are in Motion have. I only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that Bodies which are in Motion, have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Power, and thoſe that are in Reſt, have no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to keep themſelves in Reſt, becauſe the Relation that Bodies moved have to thoſe which encompaſs them, always changing, it muſt be a continual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which produces theſe continual Changes: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 'tis theſe Changes that cauſe whatſoever Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions we ſee in Nature. But there is no need of Power to do nothing: When the Relation of a Body to thoſe that ſurround it, is always the ſame; there is nothing done, and the Preſervation of this Relation, I mean, the Action of the Will of God who preſerves this Relation, is not different from that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſame Body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">By a Body in a <hi>Void,</hi> I mean one ſo ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well hard as liquid, that there is none which helps or hinders the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Motion.</note>If it is true, as I conceive, that Reſt is only a Privation of Motion, the leaſt Motion, I mean that of the leaſt agitated Body, includes more Force or Power than the reſt of the greateſt Body. Thus the leaſt Force, or ſmalleſt Body that we ſhould conceive moved in a <hi>Void,</hi> againſt a great and vaſt Body, would be capable of moving it; ſince this great Body being in Reſt, it will have no Power to reſiſt the little Body which will ſtrike againſt it; ſo that the Reſiſtance that the Parts of hard Bodies make to hinder their Separation, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily proceeds from ſome other Cauſe than that of Reſt.</p>
                        <p>But we muſt demonſtrate, by Senſile Experiments, what we have been proving by abſtracted Reaſonings, to ſee if our Idee's agree with the Senſations that we receive of Objects? For it often happens that ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments deceive us, or at leaſt cannot convince others, and particularly ſuch as are prejudiced on the contrary Side. The Authority of <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has ſo much Power over the Reaſon of ſome Men, that one muſt prove
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:107782:142"/>by all imaginable Ways, that this great Man is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be able to diſabuſe them: What I have ſaid, will make a deep Impreſſion on the Mind of thoſe that are not prejudiced with the contrary Opinion; and I plainly ſee they will blame me for proving things which appear indiſputable to them. But the Carteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans very well deſerve that I ſhould uſe my endeavour to ſatisfie them; others may paſs over this Diſcourſe, if they think it tedious.</p>
                        <p>Here then are ſome Experiments which ſenſibly prove, that Reſt has no Power to reſiſt Motion, and which conſequently diſcover that the Will of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature, which gives the Power and Force that each Body has to continue in that State wherein it is, reſpects only Motion and not Reſt; ſince Bodies have no Power of themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Experience ſhews us, that very great veſſels, which ſwim in the Water, may be agitated by the leaſt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which hit againſt them. From thence I pretend, notwithſtanding all the Evaſions of <hi>Deſcartes</hi> and the Carteſians, that if theſe great Bodies were in a Void, they might yet be more eaſily agitated: For the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why there is ſome little Difficulty to move a Veſſel in Water, is becauſe the Water reſiſts the Power of the Motion we impreſs on it, which would not happen in a Void; and what manifeſtly ſhews us, that Water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the Motion we impreſs on the Veſſel, is the Veſſels ceaſing to be agitated ſome time after it has been moved; for this would not happen, if the Veſſel did not loſe its Motion by communicating it to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or if the Water gave way without reſiſting it; or in fine, if it partook of its Motion. Thus, ſince a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel agitated in the Water, by little and little ceaſes to move; 'tis an undoubted Mark that the Water reſiſts its Motion inſtead of facilitating it, as <hi>Deſcartes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; and conſequently, it would yet be infinitely more eaſie to agitate a great Body in a Void than in Water, ſince there is no Reſiſtance from Bodies about it. It is therefore evident, that Reſt has no Power to reſiſt Motion, that the leaſt Motion contains more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Force than the greareſt Reſt: Or at leaſt, that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:107782:143"/>we ought not to meaſure the Force of Motion and Reſt by the Proportion that is found between great Bodies which are in Motion and in Reſt, as <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has done.</p>
                        <p>It is true, there is ſome Reaſon to believe that a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is agitated as ſoon as it is in the Water, becauſe of the continual Change which happens to the Parts of the Water that encompaſs it, although it ſeems to us that it does not change its Place. It is that which has made <hi>Deſcartes</hi> and ſome others believe, that 'tis not the Force only of that which impels it, that makes it advance in the Water; but having already received much Motion from the little Parts of liquid Bodies which ſurround it, and which equally puſh it on all ſides: This Motion is only determined by the new Motion of that which puſhes it: So that that which agitates a Body in Water, could not do it in a Void. Thus it is, that <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> and thoſe that are of his Opinion, defend the Rules of Motion that he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, let us ſuppoſe a Piece of Wood a Foot ſquare in a Liquid Body: All the little Parts of the Liquid Body acts upon it, and moves againſt it, and becauſe they equally puſh it on all ſides, as well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards A as B: It cannot advance nearer to one ſide than another: But if I then puſh another Piece of Wood of half a Foot, againſt the firſt, toward the Side A; I ſhall ſee it advance. And from thence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it might be moved, if in a Void, with leſs Force than that whereby this Piece of Wood puſhes it, for the Reaſons I have already brought. But the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I ſpeak of deny it, and anſwer, that what makes the great Piece of Wood advance as ſoon as it is puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the little one, is becauſe the little one which could not move it of it ſelf, being joyned with the Parts of the Liquid Body which are agitated, determine them to puſh it, and communicate to it one Part of their Motion. But 'tis plain, that according to this Anſwer, the Piece of Wood being once agitated, muſt not diminiſh its Motion, but on the contrary, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually augment it.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Art.</hi> 5.</note> For by this Anſwer the Piece of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:107782:143"/>Wood is puſhed more by the Water to the Side of A, than to the Side of B; therefore it muſt always ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards it. And becauſe this Impulſion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, its Motion muſt always increaſe. But as I have already ſaid, the Water is ſo far from facilitating its Motion, that it continually reſiſts it, and its Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance always diminiſhes it, and at laſt will make it perfectly ceaſe.</p>
                        <p>We muſt now prove, that the Piece of Wood that was equally puſhed by the little Particles of the Water that ſurrounds it, has no Motion or Power at all that is capable to move it; although it continually changes its Place, and though the Surface of the Water which encompaſſes it, is different at different Times. For if it is ſo, that a Body equally puſhed on all Sides, as this Piece of Wood is, has no Motion; it is certain, that 'tis only the Forreign Force that ſtrikes againſt it, which communicates it; ſince in the ſame Time that this forreign Force puſhes it, the Water reſiſts it, and by little and little deſtroys the Motion which is impreſt on it, for by degrees it ceaſes to move.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, at leaſt to thoſe whom I ſpeak to, that there never is in Nature more Motion at one Time than at another; and that Bodies in Reſt are moved only by meeting with ſome agitated Bodies, which communicate their Motion to them. From thence I conclude, that a Body which I ſuppoſe created perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at reſt in the middle of the Water, will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Degree of Motion from the little Particles of Water which ſurround it, and continually ſtrike againſt it, provided they puſh it equally on all Sides; becauſe all theſe little Particles which ſtrike againſt it equally on all Sides, reflecting with all their Motion, they communicate none to it; and conſequently, this Body muſt always be conſidered as in Reſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any moving Power, although it continually change its Surface.</p>
                        <p>Now the Proof I have, that theſe little Parts reflect thus with all their Motion, is, that beſides this, that we cannot conceive the thing to be otherwiſe, the Water that touches this Body, muſt grow cold, or
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:107782:144"/>even freeze, and become very near as hard as the Wood upon its Surface; ſince the Motion of the Particles of Water would be equally diſtributed to the little Parts of the Body they encompaſs.</p>
                        <p>But to accommodate my ſelf to thoſe that defend <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Sentiment, I grant, we muſt not conſider a Boat in the Water as in Reſt. I alſo allow, that all the Parts of the Water which are about it, agree to the new Motion that the Water-man imprints on it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be but too viſible by the Diminution of the Motion of the Boat, that it reſiſts it more on the Side it goes to, than from that whence it was puſhed. This ſuppoſed, I ſay, that from all the Particles of Water that are in the River, there is, according to <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> only thoſe that immediately touch the Boat on the Side from whence it was puſhed, that can aſſiſt its Motion.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Art.</hi> 63.</note> For, according to this Philoſopher, <hi>The Water being fluid, all the Parts of which it is compoſed, act not together against the Body we would move, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe, that touching it, conjoyntly bear upon it.</hi> Now, thoſe which are conjoyntly born upon the Boat, and the Waterman together, are twenty times leſs than the Boat.<note place="margin">See Art. <hi>63.</hi> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> It is therefore plain, by the Explanation, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> has given in this Article, upon the Difficulty we have to break a Nail between our Hands, that a little Body is capable of agitating a much greater than it ſelf. For indeed, our Hands are not ſo fluid as Water, and when we would break a Nail, there is more Parts joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, which act conjoyntly then in the Water which puſhes a Boat.</p>
                        <p>But here is a more Senſible Experiment: If we take a Board well plained, or ſome other very hard Plane, drive in it a Nail half-way, and ſet the Plane in an inclining Poſition, placing a Bar of Iron an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times thicker than the Nail above it, and ſuffer the Bar to ſlide down, I ſay this Nail will not break. And we muſt further obſerve, That according to <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> all the parts of this Bar reſt upon and conjoyntly act upon this Nail, for this Bar is hard and ſolid. If then <hi>there was no other Cement than reſt to unite the parts</hi> of this Nail, the Bar of Iron
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:107782:144"/>being an hundred times greater than the Nail,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Art.</hi> 63. <hi>Art.</hi> 50.</note> would according to <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s fifth Rule, and according to Reaſon, communicate ſome of its Motion to the part of the Nail it fell upon, that is, break it and paſs beyond it, although even this Bar ſhould ſlide but very ſlowly. So that we muſt ſeek another Cauſe than the Reſt of the parts, to make Bodies hard, or capable of reſiſting the Efforts that we make, when we would break them, ſince Reſt has no power to reſiſt Motion: And I believe theſe Experiments ſuffice to ſhew, that the abſtracted Proofs we have brought are not falſe.</p>
                        <p>We muſt then examine the third thing we have before ſuppoſed might be the cauſe of the ſtrict Union that is found between the parts of hard Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> An inviſible Matter that environs them, which being extreamly agitated, with much Violence puſhes the External and Internal Parts of theſe Bodies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes them after ſuch a manner, that to ſeparate them, more Force is neceſſary than this inviſible and extreamly agitated Matter has.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems then I might reaſonably conclude, that the Union of the conſtituent parts of hard Bodies depends upon the ſubtle Matter which encompaſſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes them: Since the two other things that we can think to be the Cauſes of this Union are not truly ſo, as we have already ſeen; for ſince I find reſiſtance enough in breaking a piece of Iron, and that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance proceeds neither from the Iron, nor the Will of God, as I think I have proved; it muſt neceſſarily proceed from ſome inviſible Matter, which can be no other than that which immediately encompaſſes and compreſſes it. Nevertheleſs I ſhall further give ſome poſitive Proofs of this Opinion, after I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it more at large by ſome Example.</p>
                        <p>Take a Globe of any hard Metal, which is hollow within, cut it into two Hemiſpheres, and joyn theſe two Hemiſpheres with a little Wax at the place of their union, and exhauſt the Air out of it; theſe two Hemiſpheres joyned one to the other after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if many Horſes were faſtened to them, ſome on
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:107782:145"/>one ſide and ſome on the other, could not be ſeparated by them, ſuppoſing the Magnitude of the Hemiſpheres to be in Proportion to the number of Horſes: Yet if we ſuffer the Air to re-enter, one Perſon alone could ſeparate them without any Difficulty. It is eaſie to conclude from this Inſtance, That what ſo ſtrongly unites theſe two Hemiſpheres, proceeds from their being compreſſed and ſurrounded upon their External and Convex Surface by the Air which environs them, whilſt there was no Counterpreſſure in their Internal and Concave Surface. So that the Action of the Horſes that drew the two Hemiſpheres on both ſides, could not overcome the Efforts of an infinite Number of little Particles of the Air that reſiſted them, by preſſing theſe two Hemiſpheres together. But the leaſt Force is capable of ſeparating them, when the Air, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred again within the Sphere, puſhes the Concave and Internal Surfaces, as much as the Air without preſſes the External and Convex ones.</p>
                        <p>But if, on the contrary, we take a Carps Bladder, and put it in a Veſſel, from whence all the Air has been exhauſted, this Bladder, being full of Air, will crack and break, becauſe then there is no Air without the Bladder to reſiſt that which is within. 'Tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſame Reaſon that I have given for the firſt Experiment, that two Planes of Glaſs or Marble having been uſed to be joyned one upon another, ſo that in one Senſe we find ſome reſiſtance in the ſeparating of them; becauſe theſe two parts of Marble are preſſed and conſtring'd by the External Air which encompaſſes them, and are not ſo ſtrongly puſhed by it within. I might bring an infinite Number of other Experiments, to prove that the groſs Air which environs Bodies, ſtrongly unites their Parts; but what I have ſaid, may ſuffice clearly to explain my Thoughts upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>I ſay then, that which ſo ſtrongly unites the Parts of hard Bodies, and theſe little Links I have before ſpoke on, is other little external Bodies infinitely more agitated than the Air we breath in, and theſe puſh and compreſs them; and that which gives us ſome Trouble
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:107782:145"/>to ſeparate them, is, not their Reſt, but the Agitation of theſe little Bodies which ſurround them: So that what reſiſts Motion is not Reſt, which is only a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and has no Power of it ſelf, but ſome contrary Motion.</p>
                        <p>This bare Expoſition of my Opinion perhaps ſeems reaſonable; yet I well foreſaw, that many Perſons would have ſome Difficulty to receive it. Hard Bodies make ſo great an Impreſſion upon our Senſes, when they ſtrike us, or when we make any Effort to break them, that we are inclined to believe their Parts are united much more ſtrictly than indeed they are. And on the contrary, the little Bodies which I have ſaid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſes them, and to which I have given the Power of cauſing this Union, makes no Impreſſion upon our Senſes, ſeeming to be too weak to produce ſo Senſible an Effect.</p>
                        <p>But to deſtroy this Prejudice, which is founded only upon the Impreſſions of our Senſes, and the Difficulty we have to imagine Bodies ſmaller and more agitated than thoſe we ſee every Day; we muſt conſider that the Hardneſs of Bodies muſt not be judged of in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Hands, or to the Efforts we are capable of making, which vary at different Times. For indeed, if the greateſt Force of Man is almoſt nothing in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that of the Subtle Matter, we ſhould be very much in the wrong to believe that Diamonds and the hardeſt Stones, might not have, for the Cauſe of their Hardneſs, the Compreſſion of little rapid Bodies which encompaſs them. Now we may plainly diſcover, that the Force of Man is very ſmall, if we conſider, that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he has of moving his Body into many different Ways, proceeds only from a little Fermentation of his Blood, which by agitating ſome few little Parts, ſo produces the Animal Spirits. For 'tis the Agitation of theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which gives Force to our Bodies, and gives it a Power to make theſe Efforts, that we unreaſonably look upon as ſomething very great and powerful.</p>
                        <p>But it muſt be well obſerved, that this Fermentation of our Blood is only a very little Communication of the Motion of this ſubtle Matter we ſpeak of; for all
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:107782:146"/>the Fermentations of Viſible Bodies, are only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of the Motion of Inviſible Bodies, ſince every Body receives its Agitation from ſome other. We muſt not therefore wonder if our Power is not ſo great as that of this Subtle Matter which we receive it from. But if our Blood fermented as much in our Hearts, as Gunpowder does when we put Fire to it, that is, if our Blood received as great a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Motion of this Subtle Matter, as that of Gunpowder receives: We might do extraordinary things very eaſily, as break Iron, throw down a Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> provided we ſuppoſe there was an agreeable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between our Members and the Blood thus agitated. We ought then to deſtroy our Prejudices, and not to imagine, according to the Impreſſion of our Senſes, that the Parts of hard Bodies are ſo ſtrongly united together, becauſe we have ſo much Trouble to break them. But if we ſhould conſider the Effects of Fire in Mines, in heavy Bodies, and in many other Effects of Nature, which have no other Cauſe than the Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Inviſible Bodies, as <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has proved in many Places, we ſhould manifeſtly diſcover, that 'tis not above their Power to unite and compreſs toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>her the Parts of hard Bodies as ſtrongly as we ſee they are united. For in fine, I am not afraid to affirm, that a Cannon-Bullet, whoſe Motion appears ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, does not even receive the Thouſandth Part of the Motin of the Subtle Matter that is about it.</p>
                        <p>We ſhould not doubt of what I advance, if we firſt conſidered, that Gunpowder is not all enkindled in the ſame Inſtant: Secondly, that although it ſhould all take Fire at the ſame Inſtant, it ſwims but a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while in the Subtle Matter; and Bodies which ſwim but a little while in others, cannot receive much Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them; as we may ſee in Boats that we aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the Courſe of the Water, which receive their Motion but by little and little. In the third Place, and chiefly, becauſe each Particle of Powder can receive only the Motion which the Subtle Matter impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for the Water communicates to the Veſſel, only the direct Motion which is common to all the Parts
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:107782:146"/>thereof, which is generally very ſmall in Relation to other Motions.</p>
                        <p>I could further ſhow the Greatneſs of the Motion of the Subtle Matter to thoſe that receive <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by the Motion of the Earth, and Gravity of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; and could, even from thence, bring Proofs that are certain and exact enough, but it is not neceſſary to my Subiect. It's enough, without having read the Works of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> or having a ſufficient Proof of the Agitation of this Subtle Matter, which I aſcribe as the Cauſe of the Inflexibility of Bodies, to read with ſome Application, what I have ſaid of it in the 2d. Chap. of the 4th. Book.</p>
                        <p>Being then now delivered from the Prejudices which incline us to believe that our Efforts were very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and that that of the Subtle Matter which environs and compreſſes hard Bodies, is very weak, and being otherwiſe perſwaded of the violent Agitation of this Matter, by what I have ſaid of Gunpowder: It will not be difficult to ſee that 'tis abſotutely neceſſary that the Matters acting infinitely more upon the Surface of hard Bodies that it encompaſſes and compreſſes, than within the ſame Bodies, it muſt be the Cauſe of their Inflexibility, or the Reſiſtance we feel when we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to break them.</p>
                        <p>Now, as there is always many Particles of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Matter which paſſes through the Pores of hard Bodies, they make them not only hard, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready explained, but further, are the Cauſe that ſome are Springy and Elaſtick, others ſtand bent; and that others are fluid and liquid; and in fine, that they are not only the Cauſe of the Force that hard Bodies have to continue united together, but alſo that fluid Bodies have to ſeparate, that is, are the Cauſe that ſome Bodies are hard, and others fluid.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe 'tis abſolutely neceſſary, to know di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the <hi>Phyſicks</hi> of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> the Figure of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Parts which compoſe particular Bodies, to give a Reaſon why certain Bodies are ſtiff, and ſome others pliable; I ſhall not ſtay here to explain it. Thoſe who have read the Works of this Philoſopher, will
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:107782:147"/>eaſily enough imagine what may be the Cauſe thereof, which I could not explain without great Difficulty; and thoſe who are unacquainted with this Author, would but confuſedly underſtand the Reaſon that I might bring for it.</p>
                        <p>Nor ſhall I alſo ſtop here to reſolve a great Number of Difficulties, that I foreſee may be brought againſt what I have eſtabliſhed: Becauſe, if thoſe that raiſe them have no Knowledge of true Phyſicks, I ſhould only tire and diſpleaſe them, inſtead of ſatisfying them: But if they are learned Perſons, their Objections being ſtronger, I could not anſwer them but by a great Number of Figures and long Diſcourſes; ſo that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ought to deſire thoſe that find any Difficulty in what I have advanced, very carefully to read this Chapter over again; for I hope, if they do ſo, and meditate on it as much as is neceſſary, all their Objections will vaniſh. But if they find my Requeſt incommodious, they may omit it; for there is no great Danger in being ignorant of the Cauſe of Bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility.</p>
                        <p>I ſpeak not here of <hi>Contiguity:</hi> For 'tis plain, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous things touch ſo little, that there is always much Subtle Matter which paſſes between them, and which endeavours to continue its Motion in a right Line, to prevent their uniting.</p>
                        <p>For the Union that is obſerved between Marbles which have been poliſhed one upon another, I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it, and 'tis eaſie to ſee, that although this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Matter always paſſes between theſe two Parts, how united ſoever they may be, the Air cannot paſs it; and therefore 'tis that which compreſſes and binds thoſe two Pieces of Marble together, and cauſes ſome Trouble to diſunite them, if we do not make them ſlide off one another.</p>
                        <p>It is plain, from all this, that the Continuity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity, and Union of two Marbles, will only be the ſame thing in a <hi>Void;</hi> neither have we different Idea's of them, ſo that 'tis as much as to ſay, we do not underſtand them, if we make them abſolutely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, without any Relation to the Bodies which ſurround them.</p>
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:107782:147"/>
                        <p>Here now follows ſome Reflexions upon <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Sentiment, and the Original of his error. I call his Opinion an Error, becauſe I find no Expedient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend what he ſays of the Rules of Motion, and Cauſe of the Hardneſs of Bodies, in many Places at the End of the Second Part of his Principles; and it ſeems to me, that I have ſufficiently proved the Truth of the contrary Opinion.</p>
                        <p>This great Man very diſtinctly conceived that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could not move of it ſelf, and that the Natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Power of all Bodies, was nothing elſe but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Will of the Author of Nature, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of the Motions of Bodies, at their mutual Meeting, could only proceed from this ſame Will. If we take this for granted, we can give no Rules for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Communication of Motions, but by the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is found between the different Magnitude of Bodies which beat againſt them, ſince it is impoſſible to penetrate the Deſigns of God's Will. And becauſe he judges, that every thing had Power to continue in the State it was in, whether in Motion or Reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God, by his Will, determined this Power always to act after the ſame manner; he concludes, that Reſt has as much Power to act as Motion: So he meaſures the Effects of the Power of Reſt by the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of Bodies which poſſeſſed it, as thoſe of the Power of Motion; and hence he gave the Rules for the Communication of Motion that are in his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the Cauſe of the Hardneſs of Bodies which I have endeavoured to refute.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult enough not to be of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Opinion, when we look upon it as he did; for once more, ſince the Communication of Motions proceed only from the Will of the Author of Nature, and that we ſee all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies continue in the State they are once placed in, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Motion or Reſt; It ſeems, we ought to ſeek the Rules of the different Communication of Motions at the meeting of Bodies, not in the Will of God which is unknown to us, but in the Proportion there is between the Magnitudes of theſe Bodies.</p>
                        <pb n="300" facs="tcp:107782:148"/>
                        <p>I do not therefore wonder that <hi>Deſcartes</hi> had this Thought, but I only wonder that he did not correct it, when he had made a farther Advance in his Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and found both Exiſtence and the Effects of the Subtle Matter which environs all Bodies.</p>
                        <p>I am ſurprized, that in the 132 <hi>Article of the</hi> 4th <hi>Part,</hi> he attributes the Elaſtick Force that certain Bodies have, to this ſubtle Matter, and that in Articles 55 and 43 of the Second Part, and in other Places, he does not attribute it to their Hardneſs, or the Reſiſtance they make when we endeavour to bend or break them, but to the <hi>reſt</hi> of their Parts. It appears evident to me, that the Cauſe of the Elaſticity and Stiffneſs of certain Bodies, is the ſame with that which gives them the Power of Reſiſtance, when we would break them; for indeed, the Force that we uſe to break Steel, differs but inſenſibly from that by which we bend it.</p>
                        <p>I will not here bring all the Reaſons that might be urged to prove theſe things; nor anſwer to any Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that we might form from hard Bodies making no Senſible Reſiſtance, and yet we have ſome Trouble to bend them. For it will be enough to make theſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties vaniſh, to conſider that the Subtle Matter cannot eaſily take a new courſe in Bodies which break when we bend them, as in Glaſs and in tempered Steel; and that it cannot more eaſily do it in Bodies that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of branchy Parts which are not brittle, as in Gold and Lead: And indeed, there is no hard bodies which make not ſome little Reſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult enough to perſwade our ſelves that <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> poſitively believed the Cauſe of Hardneſs was different from that of Elaſticity: And what appears moſt probable is, that he has not ſufficiently reflected upon the Matter. When we meditate long upon any Subject, and are ſatisfied in things we would know, we often think no more of them: We believe that the Thoughts that we have had, are undoubted Truths, and 'tis uſeleſs to examine farther. But in Men there are many things which diſguſt them againſt Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, incine them to a raſh Aſſent, and make them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Error; and although the Mind continues ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:107782:148"/>ſatisfied, it is not always becauſe it is well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Truth. <hi>Deſcartes</hi> was a Man like us: I confeſs we never ſaw more Solidity, Exactneſs, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and more Penetration of Mind than what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his Works; yet he was not infallible. So that it is probable he was ſo very ſtrongly perſwaded of his Opinion, from not ſufficiently reflecting that he aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething elſewhere in nis <hi>Principles</hi> contrary to it.</p>
                        <p>He maintained it upon very ſpecious and probable Reaſons, but ſuch however as were not of ſufficient Force to make us ſubmit, and therefore he might, and ought to have ſuſpended his Judgment. It is not enough to examine, in a hard Body, what might be the Cauſe that made it ſo; We ought alſo to think of the inviſible bodies which might render them hard, as he has done at the End of his Philoſophical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when he attributes the Cauſe of Reſiſtance to them: He ought to have made an exact Diviſion, which compriſed whatſoever might contribute to the Inflexibility of bodies. It is not ſufficient ſtill to ſeek the Cauſe in God's Will; he ought alſo to have thought of the Subtle Matter which environed them. For although the Exiſtence of this extreamly agitated Matter was not yet proved in that Place of his Principles where he ſpeaks of Hardneſs, it was not then rejected: He ought then to have ſuſpended his Judgment, and to have remembered that what he had writ of the Cauſe of Hardneſs, and Rules of Motion, ought to have been reviewed anew, which I believe he did not do care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enough; Or elſe he did not ſufficiently conſider the true Reaſon of a thing that is very eaſie to diſcover, and which yet is of the utmoſt Conſequence in Phyſicks; I will explain it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Deſcartes</hi> well knew, that to maintain his Syſtem, of the Truth which he could not reaſonably doubt: It was abſolutely neceſſary that great bodies ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways communicate their Motion to the leſſer bodies they ſhould meet, and the leſs reflect at their meeting with the greater, without a like Loſs on their Side. For without that, the <hi>Firſt Element</hi> would not have all
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:107782:149"/>the Motion that it is neceſſary it ſhould have above the <hi>Second,</hi> nor the <hi>Second</hi> above the <hi>Third;</hi> and his whole Syſtem would be abſolutely falſe, as is ſufficiently known to thoſe that have but thought a little upon it. But in ſuppoſing that Reſt had Force enough to reſiſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that a great Body in Reſt, could not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by another that is leſs than it, although it ſtrike it with a furious Agitation: It is plain, that great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies muſt have much leſs Motion than a like Maſs of little Bodies; ſince, according to this Suppoſition, they can always communicate what they have, and cannot always receive from the leſſer. Thus this Suppoſition not being contrary to whatſoever <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has ſaid in his <hi>Principles,</hi> from the Beginning unto the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Rules of Motion, and agreeing very well with the Sequel of his <hi>Principles;</hi> he believed that the Rules of Motions, which he thought he had demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Cauſe, were alſo ſufficiently confirmed by their Effects.</p>
                        <p>I agree with <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> that great Bodies commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their Motion much more eaſily than little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do; and therefore his Firſt Element is much more agitated than the Second, and the Second than the Third. But the Cauſe of it is clear, without having any Regard to his Suppoſition. Little and fluid Bodies, as Water, Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can only communicate to great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies an uniform Motion, which is common to all their Parts: The Water in a River can only communicate to a Boat, the Motion of Deſcent, which is common to all the little Parts of which the Water is compoſed, and every one of theſe Parts, beſides this common Motion, has alſo an infinite Number of other Particulars. Thus by this Reaſon 'tis plain, that a Boat for inſtance, can never have ſo much Motion as an equal Bulk of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince the Boat can only receive from the Water, that Motion which is direct and common to all the Parts that compoſe it. If Twenty Particles of a fluid Body puſh any other Body on the one Side, and as many on the other, it will continue immoveable, and all the little Particles of the fluid Body in which it ſwims, rebound up without loſing any thing of their
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:107782:149"/>Motion. Thus great Bodies, whoſe Parts are united, can only receive the Circular and Uniform Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Vortex of the Subtle Matter which environs them.</p>
                        <p>This Reaſon ſeems ſufficient to them, to make it comprehended how great Bodies are not ſo much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated as the leſſer, and that there is a Neceſſity for an Explanation of theſe things, to ſuppoſe any Force in Reſt to reſiſt Motion. The Certainty of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>Principles</hi> cannot be a ſufficient Proof to defend his Rules of Motion; and we may believe that if <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> himſelf had again, without Prejudice, examined his <hi>Principles,</hi> and compared them with ſuch Reaſons as I have brought, he would not have believed that the Effects of Nature had confirmed his Rules, nor have fallen into a Contradiction, by attributing the Hardneſs of Bodies only to the reſt of their Parts, and their Elaſticity to the Force of a Subtle Matter.</p>
                        <p>Here follows now the Rules of the Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Motions in a <hi>Void,</hi> which are only the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of what I have eſtabliſhed about the Nature of Reſt.</p>
                        <p>Bodies not being hard in a <hi>Void,</hi> ſince they are only hard by the Preſſure of the Subtle Matter which ſurrounds them, if Two Bodies meet, they would flatten without rebounding; we muſt therefore give theſe Rules: Suppoſe them hard of themſelves, and not by the Preſſure of this Subtle Matter.</p>
                        <p>Reſt having no Power to reſiſt Motion, and many Bodies before being conſidered as one only in the moment of their meeting; it is plain, they ought not to rebound when they are equal in Magnitude and Velocity; or that their Velocity ſupplies the Deſect of their Magnitude, or their Magnitude the Defect of their Velocity. And it is eaſie from thence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in all other Caſes they muſt always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their Motion,<note place="margin">A general Rule for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſo that they may afterwards proceed with an equal Swiftneſs.</p>
                        <p>So that to know what muſt happen in all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Suppoſitions of Magnitude and Swiftneſs of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which meet one another; we need only add toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:107782:150"/>all the Degrees of Motion of two or many Bodies, which muſt be conſidered only as one at the Time when they meer,<note place="margin">See <hi>Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s Rules in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> and after divide the Sum of all the Motions in Proportion to the Magnitude of theſe Bodies.</p>
                        <p>From whence I conclude, that of the Seven Rules that <hi>Deſcartes</hi> gives of Motion; the Three firſt are good.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth is falſe, and B muſt communicate its Motion to C, in Proportion to the Magnitude of the ſame C, and afterwards move toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So that if C is double to B, and B has Three Degrees of Motion, it muſt communicate Two of them. For I have ſufficiently proved, that <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> ought not to have ſuppoſed Reſt to have had any Force to reſiſt Motion.</p>
                        <p>That the Fifth is true.</p>
                        <p>That the Sixth is falſe, and that B muſt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Half of its Motion to C.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>And that the ſeventh is falſe, ſince B muſt always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate its Motion to C in Proportion to the Magnitude and Motion of both B and C. That if, according to the Suppoſition, C is double to B, and has three Degrees of Motion, whilſt C has but two, they muſt neceſſarily move together, ſince indeed C and B are but one Body at the Time of their Meeting; and becauſe we muſt add the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Swiftneſs which are five, and afterwards divide them in Proportion to their Magnitude, and ſo give 1⅔ to B, and 3⅓ to C the double of B. But theſe Rules although certain by what I have ſaid, are yet contrary to Experience, becauſe we are not in a <hi>Void.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The chief of all the Experiments, which are contrary to what I have ſaid of the Rules of Motion, is, that it always happens that hard Bodies which ſhock each other, do ſtill rebound different Ways, or at leaſt they do not follow one another after their meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:107782:151"/>
                        <p>To anſwer to which we muſt call to mind what has been ſaid about the Cauſe of Elactity; that there is a Matter whoſe Agitation is ſtrangely violent, which continually paſſes between the Parts of hard Bodies, and makes them ſo by compreſſing them as much upon the external as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Parts. For from thence 'tis eaſily ſeen that in the Time of Percuſſion, two Bodies which meet, drive or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Courſe of this Matter from the neareſt Places to thoſe where they are ſhockt: And this Matter reſiſting with a great Violence, repels the two Bodies which meet, and reſtores its Paſſage which the Percuſſion had ſtopt up.</p>
                        <p>That which proves yet more clearly what I have ſaid, is that if two Balls of Lead, or ſome other leſs elaſtick Matter, meet together, they rebound not after their Shock, but go on according to the Rules I have before eſtabliſhed; which they keep with ſo much the more Exactneſs, as their Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity is leſs. Bodies then rebound after their Percuſſion, becauſe they are hard, that is, as I have explained, becauſe there is a Sort of Matter much agitated which compreſſes them, and which paſſing thro' their Pores with a great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, repulſes the Bodies which ſtrike againſt one another. But we muſt ſuppoſe that the Bodies which meet break not thoſe they ſtrike againſt, by a Motion that conquers the Force, which theſe little Parts of ſubtle Matter has to reſiſt, as when we diſcharge a Musket againſt a Piece of Wood: It is true, this ſubtle Matter compreſſes ſoft Bodies, and paſſes very quickly thro' their Pores, as well as it does thro' thoſe of the hard, and that nevertheleſs theſe ſoft Bodies make no Reſiſtance. The Reaſon is becauſe the Matter which paſſes thro' ſoft Bodies, can open its Paſſage on all Sides very eaſily, becauſe of the Smallneſs of the Parts which compoſe them, or of ſome particular Configuration proper for this End, which hard Bodies cannot ſuffer, becauſe of the Groſſneſs and contrary Diſpoſition of their Parts to this effect.</p>
                        <p>Thus when a hard Body ſhocks another that is ſoft, it changes all the Ways by which the ſubtle Matter paſſes, which is often viſible, as in a Musket Bullet that is flatted when we ſtrike it. But when a hard Body hits another like it ſelf, it produces none or very ſew new Ways, and the ſubtle Matter which is within its Pores is forced to return by the Way it came, or elſe it repels thoſe Bodies which ſhut up its little Paſſages.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſe A an hard and B a ſoft Body, and C <hi>c</hi> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the ſubtle Matter, I ſay that if A ſhocks B at the Point
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:107782:151"/>
                           <hi>c,</hi> the Channel C <hi>c</hi> is obſtructed, and the ſubtle Matter finds out new Ways in this ſoft Body. Thus the ſubtle Matter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a free Paſſage, it repels not the Bodies which hit againſt it, but the Bodies themſelves change their Figure and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a little flat. And we muſt ſuppoſe that in the leaſt hard Bodies, there is an infinite Number of Channels like to C <hi>c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if A and <hi>a</hi> are two hard Bodies which meet, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage C <hi>c</hi> will be ſtraightened, and the ſubtle Matter which is there obſtructed, continuing its Motion in a right Line, muſt for want of new Paſſages, repel the Body which ſhocks it with ſo much the more Violence as its Difficulty is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to find a Way, or elſe the Parts of the Body A, will break and ſeparate from one another, and be reduced into Powder, or very ſmall Pieces.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, it appears evident that all Bodies in Motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually endeavour to keep in a right Line, and turning the leaſt that is poſſible when they meet with any Reſiſtance, they muſt never reflect, ſince by reflecting they deviate much from a right Line. It muſt therefore be either that Bodies become flat, or that the ſtrongeſt overcome the weakeſt, and make it move the ſame Way the other does. But becauſe Bodies are elaſtick and hard, they cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one another, ſince if A puſhes <hi>a, a</hi> will repel A again, and ſo they muſt keep aſunder from one another.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, if the two Bodies were in a Void, altho' they were very Hard, they would follow one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe having no Bodies about them, they could have no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick Force, the ſhocked not at all reſiſting that which ſhocks it: But Air, Gravity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> reſiſting the great Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the ſtriking Body gives to that it ſtrikes, the ſtricken reſiſts the ſtriking, and hinders it from following it: For Experience teaches us that Air and Gravity reſiſts Motion, and ſo much the more as the Motion is more violent.</p>
                        <p>It is eaſie to diſcover by what I have ſaid, why when different Bodies meet which are ſurrounded with Air, or Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſometimes that which ſtrikes, rebounds, and ſometimes it communicates all its Motion, and continues as if it were immovable, and ſometimes follows the ſtricken, but always with leſs Swiftneſs, if either of them is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoft: For the whole depends only upon the Proportion which is between their Magnitude, Hardneſs and Gravity, ſuppoſing they are moved with an equal Swiftneſs.</p>
                        <p>If they are very inflexible, the ſtriking Body rebounds more, becauſe the Elaſticity is ſtronger. If the ſtriking is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:107782:152"/>very ſmall, and the ſtricken very great and heavy, the ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will rebound ſtill more, becauſe of the Weight and great Quantity of Air which encompaſſes the ſtricken that reſiſts this Motion. In fine, if the Force of the Hardneſs is either diminiſhed or encreaſed by the Colum of Air which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the ſtricken, the ſtriking which rebounds would continue in Reſt after Percuſſion. Or on the contrary, the ſtriking which would continue in Reſt after the Percuſſion may rebound.</p>
                        <p>All that is to be done then, is to compare the Hardneſs of Bodies which meet, and the Air which the impuls'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt agitate anew in the Time of Percuſſion that it may move, to foreſee very near what muſt happen in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of different Bodies. I always ſuppoſe an equal Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the meeting, for the Air reſiſts a great Motion more than it does a ſmall one, and there is as much Motion in a Body half as little again as another, when it goes as faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as this other: Thus the ſtricken being puſhed twice as ſwift again, it may be conſidered as having a Colum of Air twice as great to impel it.</p>
                        <p>But we muſt alſo obſerve, that in the Moment that one Body ſhocks another, the Parts of theſe ſame Bodies have two contrary Motions: For thoſe that are foremoſt have an Inclination to turn becauſe of the Shock, at the ſame Time that thoſe that are behind, incline to advance becauſe of the firſt Motion, and 'tis this Countermotion that flattens ſoft Bodies, and even makes certain hard Bodies break. Now when Bodies are very hard, this counterblow which ſhakes their Parts, and cauſes a kind of trembling in them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Sound they make, always produces ſome Change in the Communication of Motion, which is very difficult to be diſcovered for many Reaſons, and it ſeems to me very uſeleſs to examine it in particular.</p>
                        <p>If one would think upon all theſe things, I believe he might eaſily anſwer ſome Difficulties that may ſtill remain upon this Subject. But if I thought what I have ſaid was not ſufficient to ſhew that Reſt has no Power to reſiſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the Rules of the Communication of Motion given by <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> are in Part falſe, I would here prove, that according co his Suppoſition, 'twould be impoſſible to move in the Air; and that what makes the Circulation of Motion in fluid Bodies to be poſſible without recurring to a <hi>Void,</hi> is that the firſt Element being eaſily divided after many different Manners, the reſt of its Parts would have no Power to reſiſt Motion.</p>

                     <head>THE CONCLUSION OF THE Three Laſt Books.</head>
                     <p>IT ſeems to me, that I have in the fourth and fifth Book ſufficiently ſhown, that the Natural Inclinations and Paſſions of Men make them often fall into Error; becauſe they incline them more to precipitate Judgments, than to examine things carefully.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth Book I have ſhown, that the Inclination for Good in general, is the cauſe of the Wills inquietude: That the Inquietude of the Will puts the Mind into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Agitation: And that a Mind that is always agitated, is wholly incapable of diſcovering Truths that are but a little intricate: That the Love of new and extraordinary things, often prejudice us in favour of them; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever bears the Character of Infinity, is capable of dazling our Imagination and ſeducing us. I have explained, how the Inclination we have for Greatneſs, Honours, and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, inſenſibly engage us into falſe Learning, or into the Study of all theſe vain and uſeleſs Sciences, which flatter our ſecret Pride, becauſe they make us be admir'd by the Vulgar. I have ſhew'd, that our Inclinations for Pleaſure continually turn the Mind from the Contemplation of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Truths, which are the moſt Simple and moſt Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and permit it not to conſider any thing, with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Attention and Diſintereſt to be able to judge well of it: That Pleaſures being the Modes of the Souls Exiſtences, they neceſſarily divide the Capacity of the Mind, and a Mind divided cannot fully comprehend whatever has any thing of Extenſion. In fine, I have ſhewn, that the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Natural Union we have with all thoſe we live
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:107782:153"/>with, is the occaſion of many Errors that we are ſubject to, and communicate to others, as others communicate thoſe to us, wherein they fall themſelves.</p>
                     <p>In the fifth Book I have endeavoured to give ſome Idea of our Paſſions; I have, I think, ſufficiently ſhewn, that they are eſtabliſhed to unite us to all ſenſible things, to aſſiſt with a Diſpoſition which is proper for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Life: And that as our Senſes unite us to our Body, and diffuſe our Soul, if I may ſo ſay, into all the parts which compoſe it; ſo our Emotions make us, as it were, go out of our ſelves, to be diffuſed through all things that are about us. And laſtly, That they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repreſent things to us, not as they are in themſelves, to form true Judgments, but according to the Relation they have to us, to form Judgments that are uſeful for the Preſervation of our Being, and of thoſe with whom we are naturally or voluntarily united.</p>
                     <p>After having attempted to diſcover our Errors in their Cauſes, and to deliver the Mind from the Prejudices to which it is ſubject, I thought it was time to prepare it for an Enquiry after Truth. Thus I have in the ſixth Book explained the means which ſeem to me the moſt Natural to increaſe the Attention and Capacity of the Mind, by ſhewing the uſe that we may make of our Senſes, Paſſions, and Imagination; to give it all the Force and Penetration whereof it is capable. Afterwards I have eſtabliſhed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rules that are neceſſary to be obſerved in the Diſcovery of any Truth whatever it be, I have explained them by many Inſtances to make them more ſenſible, and have made choice of thoſe which appeared the moſt uſeful to me, or which included the moſt pregnant and general Truths, that they may be read with more Application, and made more Senſible and Familiar.</p>
                     <p>If may be by this Eſſay of <hi>Method</hi> we ſhall diſcover the Neceſſity there is of reaſoning upon clear and eviden: Idea's; and ſuch as we are inwardly convinced that all Nations agree in; and never paſs to Compound things, before we have ſufficiently examined the Simple ones upon which thoſe depend.</p>
                     <p>And if we conſider that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his Followers have not obſerved the Rules I have explained, as we ought to be convinced by the Proofs I have brought of it, and by a Knowledge of the Opinions of the moſt Zealous Defenders of this Philoſopher, perhaps we ſhall condemn his Doctrine,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:107782:153"/>notwithſtanding all the Impreſſions which perſwade ſome who ſuffer themſelves to be entangled by words they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not.</p>
                     <p>But if we obſerve the manner of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Philoſophy, we cannot doubt of Solidity; for I have ſufficiently ſhewn, that he reaſons only upon clear and evident Idea's, and begins with the moſt Simple things, before he paſſes to the more Compound, which depend upon them. Thoſe who read the Works of this Learned Man, will be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of what I ſay of him, provided they read them with all the Application that is neceſſary to comprehend them; and they will feel a ſecret Joy for being born in ſo Happy an Age, ſince we may be freed from the trouble of enquiring into paſt Ages amongſt the Heathens, and in the utmoſt parts of the Earth among Barbarians or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to find a Doctor to inſtruct us in the Truth.</p>
                     <p>But as we ought not to be too ſolicitous to know the Opinions of Men, even though we were otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they had diſcovered the Truth; ſo I ſhould be very ſorry if the Eſteem I have here expreſſed for <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> ſhould prejudice any Perſon in his Favour, or incline him to ſatisfie himſelf with a bare reading and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his Opinions, without ſeeking to be illuminated with the Light of Truth. It would be to prefer Man to God, to conſult him in the place of our Maker, and to content our ſelves with the obſcure anſwers of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher who enlightens us not, to ſhun the trouble of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting by Meditation of him who anſwers and enlightens us both together.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a very unworthy thing to become the Partizan of any Sect whatever, and to look upon the Authors of it as if they were infallible: And <hi>Deſcartes</hi> himſelf had rather make Men Diſciples of Truth, than prejudiced Followers of his Opinions: As he expreſly advertiſes them, <hi>That they give no Faith to whatever he has written,<note place="margin">And the end of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> but only receive what the force and evidence of Reaſon conſtrains them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> He would not, like ſome Philoſophers, be believed upon his word, he always maintains, That he is but a Man; and that diffuſing Light only by Reflection, thoſe that would be inſtructed by him, ought to turn their Minds towards the Sovereign Reaſon, which alone can make it more perfect by the Gift of Underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>The chief uſe that we can draw from applying our ſelves to Study, is to make the Mind more Juſt, Clear, Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:107782:154"/>and fit to diſcover whatever Truths we would know. But thoſe that read Philoſophers to retain their Opinions, and put them off to others, are very far from approaching to that which is the Life and Nouriſhment of the Soul: Their Minds are weakned and blinded by the Commerce they have with thoſe who can neither inſtruct nor fortifie them; they fill themſelves with a falſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the weight of which oppreſſes them, and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it dazles them, and fancy they become very Learned, when their Heads are full of the Opinions of Ancient Philoſophers, never reflecting that they make themſelves the Diſciples of thoſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Became Fools by attributing to themſelves the Name of Wiſe-Men. Dicentes ſe eſſe ſapientes ſtulti lacti ſunt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I believe the Method I have given, may be of much uſe to thoſe who would make uſe of their Reaſon, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God the anſwers he gives to all thoſe who know how to interrogate him; for I think I have mentioned the chief things that can fortifie and conduct the Attention of the Mind, which is the Natural Prayer that we make to the true Maſter of all Men, in order to be inſtructed.</p>
                     <p>But as this Natural Proſpect of enquiring after the Truth, is very Painful, and commonly Impracticable for reſolving Queſtions of ſmall moment, the Knowledge of which ſerves oftner to flatter our Pride than to perfect our Minds: I believe that to finiſh this Work uſefully, I ought to ſay, that the ſhorteſt and moſt certain Method to diſcover the Truth, and unite us to God after the moſt perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner poſſible, is to live like a true Chriſtian; to follow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the Precepts of the Eternal Truth, which unites it ſelf with us, only to re-unite us to it ſelf; to hearken to our Faith rather than our Reaſon; and incline to God not ſo much by our Natural Powers, which ſince Sin are wholly corrupted, as by the aſſiſtance of Faith, by which alone God would conduct us into this immenſe Light of Truth, which would diſſipate all our Darkneſſes. For in fine, It is much better, like good Men, to paſs ſome years in the Ignorance of certain things, and in a moment find our ſelves inſtructed in them for ever, than by natural ways, and much Application and Trouble, acquire a very imperfect Science, which will leave us in Darkneſs to all Eternity.</p>

                  <p>WHEN a Book is to be Publiſh'd, the Author never knows who to conſult to learn its Fate. The Stars do not precede at its Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their Influences have no Power over it, and the boldeſt Aſtrologers dare not make the leaſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions upon the different Fortunes it is to be expos'd to. Truth being not of this World, Coeleſtial Bodies have no power over it; and as the Nature of it is altogether Spiritual, the divers Poſitions of Matter can no wiſe contribute towards its Eſtabliſhment or Ruin. Moreover, Mens Judgments are ſo different in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſame things, that it is almoſt impoſſible to gueſt with more raſhneſs and imprudence, about any thing, than the happy or unhappy ſucceſs of a Book. So that whoever ventures to be an Author, ventures at the ſame time to be thought what every
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:107782:155"/>Man pleaſes. But among Authors, thoſe who oppoſe Prejudices, may be certain of their Condemnation: Their Works diſpleaſe moſt Men; and when they ſcape the Paſſions of their Enemies, they are only indebted for their deliverance to the Almighty Power of Truth which protects them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a common defect in all Men to be too quick in Judging; for all Men are liable to Error, and 'tis only that defect which makes them liable to it. Now all raſh Judgments are ever liable to Prejudices; therefore thoſe Authors who oppoſe them, can never fail of being condemn'd by all thoſe who conſult their Ancient Opinions, as the Laws by which they are always to pronounce. For, in fine, moſt Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are at once the Judge and Party, in reſpect of thoſe Authors. They are Judges, no body can diſpute it; and they are Parties, becauſe thoſe Authors diſturb them in the poſſeſſion of their Prejudices, upon which they have a right of Preſcription, and with whom they have been familiar for many years.</p>
                  <p>I own, that there is a great deal of Equity, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and good Sence, in many Readers; and that there are Judges, who are ſo reaſonable as not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low common Opinions as the Infallible Rules of Truth. There are ſome, who looking within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſult inward Truth, according to which we ought to Judge of all things; but there but few of thoſe who conſult it on all occaſions; and none at all, who conſult it with all the Attention and Fidelity that is neceſſary, in order always to pronounce true Judgments. Therefore, tho' one ſhould ſuppoſe that there were no faults to be found in a Book, which no body can do without Vanity, I do not believe that one could find out one Man, who would approve it in all reſpects, particularly if it were a Book that did oppoſe his Prejudices, ſince it is not Naturally poſſible that a Judge continually offended, incens'd abus'd by a Party, ſhould do him ſtrict Juſtice, and that he would give himſelf the trouble to uſe his utmoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and power, to conſider Reaſons which ſeem to him at firſt ſight extravagant Paradoxes, or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Paralogiſms.</p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:107782:155"/>
                  <p>But tho' we find many things in a Book that pleaſe us, if we chance to meet with any that offend us, we ſeldom fail to exclaim againſt it, and we often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to ſpeak well of it. There are a thouſand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Self-love, which induce us to condemn what diſpleaſes us, and reaſon, on that occaſion, fully juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies thoſe Motives; for Men fancy they condemn Error and defend Truth, when they defend their Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and condemn thoſe who attack them. Thus the moſt Equitable Judges of Books, which oppoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, commonly give General Judgments of them which are not very favorable to thoſe that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them. They may chance to ſay, that there are ſome good things in ſuch a Work, and that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor refutes certain Prejudices reaſonably enough, but they will not fail to condemn it, and to decide like Judges with Authority and Gravity; and to ſay, that he carries things too far on ſuch and ſuch occaſions. For when an Author fights againſt Opinions, which the Reader is not prejudic'd with, whatever the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſays ſeems rational enough: But the Author always carries matters too far, when he oppoſes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices in which the Reader is too far engag'd.</p>
                  <p>Now, as the Prejudices of different Perſons are not always the ſame, ſhould any one carefully collect the divers Judgments which are given upon the ſame things, we would often find that according to thoſe Judgments, there would be nothing good, nor yet, at the ſame time, any thing bad, in thoſe ſorts of Works. There would be nothing good, for there are no Prejudices but what are approv'd by ſome People; and there would be nothing bad, for there are no Prejudices but what are diſlik'd by ſome. Therefore thoſe Judgments are ſo equitable, that ſhould Authors be willing to take the advantage of them to reform their Works, they would be obliged to blot out all, for fear of leaving any thing that were condemn'd, or elſe alter nothing at all, for fear of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering any thing that were approv'd. So that a poor Author, who is unwilling to offend any body, finds himſelf ſtrangely at a loſs, among all thoſe different
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:107782:156"/>Judgments which are given in all Parts againſt him, and in favour of him; and unleſs he reſolves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſteady, and to paſs for an obſtinate Man in his Sentiments, he is oblig'd of neceſſity to contradict himſelf every moment, and to aſſume as many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Shapes as there are different Heads in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>However, Time does every one Juſtice; and Truth, which at firſt appears like a Chimerical ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Phantaſm, is reliſh'd by degrees: Men open their Eyes, they view it, diſcover its Charms, and are mov'd by it. He who condemns an Author upon a Sentiment which offends him, accidentally meets with another who approves that Sentiment, and who, on the contrary, condemns ſome Opinions the other receives as undeniable: Every one ſpeaks his Mind, and every one contradicts the other. They Examine their own Reaſons a-new, as alſo thoſe of the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents: They diſpute, they are mindful, they heſitate, they do no longer Judge ſo raſhly of what they have not Examin'd; and when they chance to alter their Opinion, and to find that the Author is more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than they thought, a ſecret Inclination ariſes within their Hearts, which often induces them to give him as good a Character as they gave him a bad one before. Therefore, he than ſticks cloſe to Truth, tho' he offends at firſt, and is look'd upon as Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, muſt not diſpair of ſeeing that Truth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, Triumph at ſome time or other over the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of Men; for there is this difference between good and ill Books, between thoſe that Inſtruct the Mind, and thoſe which Flatter the Senſes and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that the latter ever appear Charming and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful at firſt, and Time withers them; whereas the other, on the contrary, have ſomething odd and diſguſting, which frightens at firſt; but they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in time, by the degrees as Men read them, and meditate on them, for Time commonly regulates the Price of things.</p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:107782:156"/>
                  <p>Books which engage Prejudices leading to Truth by a new way, require yet more time than others to produce the Fruit which Authors expect from them: For, as Men are often deceiv'd in the hopes that are given by thoſe who Compoſe theſe ſorts of Books, there are but few that read them, leſs who approve them, and almoſt all condemn them whether they read them or no: And tho' it be known that the moſt beaten Paths do not lead where one deſigns to go, yet that dread Men conceive at the very entrance of thoſe that are untrodden, diſcourages them from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in them. People ſeldom look up to ſee their way, they blindly follow thoſe who go before; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany diverts and comforts; they do not reflect on what they are doing; they are not ſenſible whether they are going, and they often forget whither they deſign to go.</p>
                  <p>Men are made to live in Society; but to maintain it, it is not ſufficient to ſpeak the ſame Tongue, they muſt ſpeak the ſame Senſe; muſt think alike. They muſt live by Opinion as they act by Imitation. Men think conveniently, agreeably, and ſafely, for the good of the Body, and for the ſettling of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, when they are of the Opinion of others, and when they ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded by the Air, or ſenſible Impreſſion of the Imagination of thoſe who ſpeak to them. But thoſe ſuffer conſiderably, and expoſe themſelves to great dangers, who will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearken to inward Truth, and who reject, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and horror, all the Prejudices of the Sences, and all the Opinions that have been received without Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thoſe Writers, who oppoſe Prejudices, are very much miſtaken, if they expect to recommend themſelves by it. If they ſucceed, perhaps a ſmall number of the Learned may ſpeak Honorably of their Work, when they are Dead; but while they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, they muſt expect to be neglected by moſt Men, and Deſpis'd, Calumniated, and Perſecuted, by thoſe very Perſons they look upon to be very Wiſe and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.</p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:107782:157"/>
                  <p>And indeed, there are ſo many Reaſons, ſuch ſtrong and ſuch convincing Arguments, which oblige us to Act, like thoſe we live with that Men are often in the right to condemn thoſe that are ſingular as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious and fantaſtical Perſons; and whereas Men do not make a ſufficient diſtinction between Acting and Thinking, they commonly are diſpleas'd that any body ſhould oppoſe Prejudices: They fancy that it is not ſufficient to obſerve the Rules of Civil Society, to conform outwardly to the Opinions and Cuſtoms of the Country they live in. They think it a prece of Temerity to examine Common Opinions, and that to conſult Truth is a breach of Charity; becauſe it is not ſo much Truth which unites Civil Societies as Opinion and Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is receiv'd in Univerſities as the Rule of Truth; he is Quoted as Infallible. It is a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Hereſie to deny what he advances. In a word, he is reſpected as the Genius of Natures, and thoſe who are beſt vers'd in his Phyſicks, can give no reaſon for any thing, and perhaps are convinc'd of nothing; and Scholars that have read their courſe of Philoſophy, dare hardly ſay, before Men of Senſe, what they have learnt of their Maſters. That, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, may make thoſe who reflect upon it, ſenſible of what we are to think of thoſe ſorts of Studies; for a Science, which we muſt forget to become rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, does not ſeem very ſolid. Nevertheleſs, thoſe would be look'd upon as inconſiderate and raſh, who ſhould attempt to diſcover the falſity of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which Authoriſe ſo extraordinary a Conduct; and they ſhould not fail of being troubled by thoſe who receive advantage by them, if they were ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to undeceive the Public.</p>
                  <p>Is is not evident, that the way to learn what we do not know, is to uſe what we do know? And that it would be a Jeſt to give a <hi>Frenchman</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Grammar in Verſe to teach <hi>High Dutch?</hi> Yet it is cuſtomary to give Children the <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpauterius</hi> to teach them <hi>Latin;</hi> obſcure Verſes in all reſpects, to Children, who have much ado to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:107782:157"/>the eaſieſt things. Reaſon and Experience, are viſible againſt that Cuſtom, for Children are a long while a learning Latin ill. Nevertheleſs, 'tis Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to find fault with it; ſhould a <hi>Chineſe</hi> hear this Cuſtom, he could not forbear laughing at it, whilſt on this part of the World we Inhabit, the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and the moſt Learned cannot forbear approving it.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch falſe and ſuch abſurd Prejudices and Cuſtoms, that are ſo unreaſonable, and of ſuch great conſequence, have a World of Protectors, how is it to be expected that People ſhould ſubmit to Reaſons which engage Prejudices that are purely Speculative? A little attention is ſufficient to diſcover, that the Method which is uſed to teach Children is none of the beſt, and yet it is not minded; Opinion and Cuſtom prevail over Reaſon and Experience. How then could any body expect that Works which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a great number of Prejudices, ſhould not be condemn'd in many things, even by thoſe who paſs for the moſt Learned, and for the Wiſeſt?</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that thoſe who paſs in the World fox the beſt Judges and the beſt Scholars, are thoſe who have ſtudy'd moſt Books both good and bad; they are thoſe who have the Memories, and whoſe Imagination is more lively, and more extended than others. Now thoſe Men commonly Judge of things raſhly, and without deliberation. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their Memory, in which they find immediately the Law or the Prejudice, according to which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide without much Reflection. As they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Wiſer than others, they give but little heed to what they read. Therefore it happens often, that Women and Children diſcover the falſity of certain Prejudices which have been controverted, becauſe they dare not paſs their Judgments upon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Examination, but uſe all the attention they are capable of in what they read; whereas, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Learned perſiſt in their Opinions, becauſe they will not give themſelves the trouble to examine thoſe of others, when they are directly oppoſite to what they think already.</p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:107782:158"/>
                  <p>As for thoſe that live with great Men, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on ſo many things that they cannot eaſily retire into themſelves, nor afford a ſufficient attention to diſtinguiſh what is true from what is likely. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, they are not much wedded to certain Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, for the beſt way to hold ſtrongly with the World, is neither to be wedded to Truth nor Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. As apparent humility, or good breeding, and external moderation, are qualifications that pleaſe every body, and which are abſolutely neceſſary to maintain Society among thoſe who have a great deal of Pride and Ambition, the Men of the World affect not to affirm any thing, or to believe any thing as undeniable. It ever was, and ever will be the faſhion, to look upon all things as Problematical, and to ſpeak at random even of the moſt holy Truths, leſt they ſhou'd ſeem wedded to any thing. For as thoſe I am ſpeaking of, apply themſelves to nothing, and mind nothing but their Fortune, no diſpoſition can ſeem ſo convenient, and ſo reaſonable to them, as that which cuſtom juſtifies. Therefore thoſe who attack Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, flattering on the one hand the Pride and Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Men of the World, they are well receiv'd by them; but when they pretend to affirm any thing as undeniable, and to diſcover the Truth of Religion, and of Chriſtian Morality, they look upon them as conceited Men, and as Perſons, who to avoid one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice leap into another.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid, in my Opinion, is ſufficient to ſhow what I could anſwer to the different Judgments divers perſons have given againſt the Book, Intituled, <hi>A Search after Truth;</hi> and I will forbear making an application which every one may make uſefully and eaſily. I am ſenſible that every body will not do it; but it would look, perhaps, as if I would do my ſelf Juſtice, in defending my ſelf as much as I could, therefore I abandon my Right to the Judicious Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are the Natural Judges of Books: And I conjure them to remember my Requeſt in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> and elſewhere: <hi>Only to Judge of my Sentiments according to the clear and diſtinct
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:107782:158"/>Anſwers they ſhall receive from the only Maſter of all Mankind, after having made their application to him by a ſerious, attention.</hi> For if they conſult their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices as the deciſive Laws of what they are to believe of the Book, Intituled, <hi>A Search after Truth,</hi> I own that it is a very ill Book, ſince it is written oh pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſcover the Falſity and Injuſtice of thoſe Laws.</p>

                     <p>BEcauſe the following <hi>Explanations</hi> were writ to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy ſome particular Perſons, who deſired a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Explication of ſome Material Truths, I think fit to premiſe, that what I ſhall ſay may be clearly underſtood, it will be neceſſary for every one to have ſome knowledge of the Principles I've explain'd in the <hi>Search after Truth:</hi> Therefore 'twill be beſt not to meddle with theſe Obſervations, till we've firſt carefully read the whole Work for which they were written; and at the ſecond reading, only examine them as they are referr'd to in the Margent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet is not this Caution abſolutely neceſſary to be obſerved by Learned Perſons, becauſe I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd ſo to compoſe theſe <hi>Explanations,</hi> that they might be read without referring to the Book they were written for; Truth, I know, of all things, gives us the leaſt trouble to find it out.

                     <argument>
                        <p>God acts whatever is real in the motions of the Mind, and in the determination of theſe Motions, yet he is not the Author of Sin.</p>
                        <p>He acts whatever is real in the Senſations of Concupiſcence, and yet he is not the Author of our Concupiſcence.</p>

                     <p>SOme think I too ſoon forſake the compariſon betwixt <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> and believe that the firſt has no more power than the ſecond to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the impreſſion that it receives from God; they would have me explain, if I can, what God does in us, and what we do our ſelves when we Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe, as they pretend, I ſhall be forced to grant either that Man can give himſelf a new Modification, or elſe that God is truly the Author of Sin.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, That Faith, Reaſon, and the inward Conſciouſneſs I have of my ſelf, oblige me to leave my compariſon where I do, for I am every way
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:107782:160"/>convinced, that I have in my ſelf a principle of my own determinations; and I have ſome Reaſons to believe, that Matter has no ſuch principle in it ſelf, as will be proved hereafter. But this is what God does in us, and what we do our ſelves when we Sin.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God impels us continually by an invincible impreſſion towards Good in general. Secondly, he repreſents to us the Idea of a particular Good, or gives us a Senſation of it: In fine, he carries us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this particular Good.</p>
                     <p>God impels us continually towards Good in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for he has made us, and keeps us for himſelf, he will have us love every thing that is good; he is the firſt or rather the only mover: In fine, this appears clearly by a great many things that I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and thoſe that I have to do withal do grant it.</p>
                     <p>God repreſents to us the Idea of a particular Good, or gives us a Senſation of it, for it is only he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens us; and the bodies that are about us can't act upon our Mind: In one word, we are not our own light, nor make our-own felicity: I have proved it at large in the Third Book, and elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>In fine, God carries us towards this particular <hi>Good.</hi> For God carrying us towards what is good, 'tis a neceſſary conſequence that he ſhould carry us towards particular <hi>goods</hi> when he produces the Idea or the Senſation of 'em in our Soul. This is all what God does in us when we Sin.</p>
                     <p>But as one particular <hi>good</hi> does not include all <hi>goods,</hi> and as the Mind conſidering it with a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct view can't imagine that it includes 'em all; God does not carry us neceſſarily or invincibly to the love of this good, we are ſenſible that we are free to ſtop there, that we have motion to go farther; in one word, that the impreſſion which we have for good in general, or to ſpeak as others, that our Will is neither conſtrained nor neceſſitated to ſtop at this particular <hi>good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:107782:160"/>
                     <p>This is then what the Sinner does; he ſtops, he reſts, he follows not the impreſſion of God; he acts not, for Sin is nothing. He knows that the great Rule he muſt obſerve, is to make uſe of his liberty as much as he can, and that he muſt ſtick at no good if he be not inwardly convinced, that it would be againſt order not to ſtick at it. If he does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this Rule by the light of his Reaſon, he learns it, at leaſt, by the inward reproaches of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; he ought then to follow the impreſſion which he receives towards good in general, and think of other goods than that he enjoys, which he ought only to make uſe of; for it is by thinking of other goods than thoſe he enjoys, that he may produce in himſelf new determinations of love, and make uſe of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Now I prove, that by the impreſſion that God gives him towards good in general, he may think of other goods than thoſe he enjoys, becauſe 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in this that the difficulty lies.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a Law of Nature, that the Ideas of Objects ſhould preſent themſelves to our Mind, as ſoon as we will think of 'em, provided the capacity we have of thinking be not fill'd by the quick and confuſed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations we receive from what paſſes in our Body. Now we may <hi>be willing</hi> to think of all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the natural impreſſion which impels us towards good, does extend to all the things that we may think of, and we may at all times think of all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are united to him that includes the Ideas of all things, as I proved<note place="margin">n="*" Read the Chapter of the 3d Book, whoſe Title is, <hi>That we ſee all things in God;</hi> and the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Chapter.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                     <p>If it be then true, that we may <hi>be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to conſider nearly what we already ſee as afar off, ſince we are united to the Univerſal Being; and if it be certain, that by virtue of the Law of Nature, Ideas come near us, as ſoon as we deſire it, it muſt be concluded;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That we have a principle of our determinations;</hi> for it is the actual preſence of particular Ideas which determines poſitively towards particular goods, the motion we have towards good in general; and which
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:107782:161"/>thus changes our natural love into free love. Our aſſent or acquieſcence at the ſight of a particular good, is nothing real or poſitive on our part, as I ſhall explain hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That this Principle of our Determinations is always free in reſpect to particular gooods;</hi> for we are not invincibly impelled to love 'em; ſince we may examine 'em in themſelves; and compare them with the Idea we have of the ſoveraign good, or with other particular goods; ſo the principle of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is, that being made for God, and united to God, we may always think of the true good, or of ſome other goods than thoſe of which we actually think.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe nevertheleſs, that our Senſations do not fill all the capacity of our Mind; for that we may be free with the liberty I ſpeak of, it is neceſſary, not only that God ſhould not invincibly impel us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards particular goods, but alſo that we may make uſe of the impreſſion we have towards good in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to love ſome other thing than that we actually love. Now as we can love no Object but thoſe we may think of, nor actually think of any other but thoſe that cauſe too quick Senſations in us; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the dependance we have upon our Body leſſens our liberty, nay does on many occaſions take away the uſe of it. So our Senſations deſtroying out Ideas, and the union we have with our Body, by which we only ſee, or rather feel our ſelves, weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which we have with God, by which all things are preſent to us; the Mind muſt not ſuffer it ſelf to be divided by confuſed Senſations, if it be willing always to have the principle of its determinations to be free.</p>
                     <p>It appears from all this, that God is not the Author of Sin, and that Man does not give himſelf new Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: God is not the Author of Sin, ſince he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually imprints a motion to go farther on him who Sins, or ſtops at a particular good, and he gives him the power to think of other things, and to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to other goods than that which actually is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:107782:161"/>of his thought and of his love; that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him not to love thoſe things which he can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear loving without being troubled by any remorſes; and he continually calls him to himſelf by the ſecret reproaches of his Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Is is true, Gob does in one ſenſe impel the Sinner to love the Object of his Sin, if this Object appears to be good to the Sinner; for, as moſt Divines ſay, all that is poſitive in Sin, or what there is of act or motion, proceeds from God. But it is only through a falſe judgment of our Mind that the Creatures ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear good to us, that is capable of acting in us and making us happy. The Sin of a Man lies in this, that he does not refer all the particular Goods to the Soveraign Good; or rather in that he does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider nor love the Severaign Good in the particular Goods; and ſo does not regulate his Love according to the Will of God, or according to the eſſential and neceſſary order of which all Men have a knowledge, and which is ſo much the more perfect as they are more ſtrictly united to God, and are leſs ſenſible of the impreſſions of their Senſes and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.<note place="margin">See the Explanations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Third Chapter of the Second Part of the Sixth Book, towards the end, where I explain my thoughts more diſtinctly.</note> For our Senſes diffuſe our Souls through our whole Bodies, and our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions tranſport them, if I may ſo ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Objects which are about us, they remove us from the light of God which enlightens us.</p>
                     <p>Neither does Man give himſelf new Modifications, for the motions of love that God continually imprints upon us increaſes, or diminiſhes not, whether we actually love or not; I mean, although this natural motion of love be, or be not determined by any Idea of our Mind. This motion does not ceaſe even by its acquieſcence in the poſſeſſion of Good, as the motion of Bodies ceaſes by their reſt. 'Tis probable that God always impels us with an equal force towards him; for he inclines us towards good in general as much as we are capable of, and we are at all times equally capable of it, becauſe our Will, or Natural capacity of Willing is always equal in it ſelf. Thus
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:107782:162"/>the impreſſion or Natural motion which carries us towards good, neither increaſes or diminiſhes.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs we have no clear Idea, nor even any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senſation of this equality of impreſſion or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motion towards Good. But 'tis becauſe, as I have elſewhere proved, that we know not our ſelves by a clear Idea; not are we conſcious of our own Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whilſt they don't actually operate: we do not feel in our ſelves, what is natural, common, and always the ſame, as we are not ſenſible of the heat and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Hearts. We are not likewiſe ſenſible of our Habits, and whether we are worthy of the Love or Wrath of God. There is perhaps in us an infinite number of Faculties which are abſolutely unknown to us; for we have no internal Senſation of what we are, but only of what we feel. If we had never felt Pain, nor a deſire for particular Goods, we could not by the internal Senſation we have of our ſelves, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover whether we ſhould be capable of feeling Pain, or willing ſuch Goods. 'Tis our Memory, and not our internal Senſation that teaches us we are capable of feeling what we no longer feel, or of being agitated by Paſſions, which at preſent we feel no motions of. Thus there is nothing which hinders us from believing that God always inclines us towards him with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual force, although after a very different manner: He always preſerves in our Souls an equal capacity of willing, or one and the ſame will, as in all matter he preſerves an equal quantity of motion. But although it were not certain, I don't ſee how we can ſay that the encreaſe or diminution of the natural motion of our Souls depends upon us, ſince we cannot be the cauſe of the extension of our own Will.</p>
                     <p>It is however certain, by what I have ſaid before, that God produces, and alſo preſerves whatſoever is real and poſitive in the particular determinations of the motions of our Souls, whether Ideas or Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For 'tis he who determines our motions for a general Good, towards particular Goods; but not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an invincible manner, ſince we have a tendency to go farther. So that all we do when we ſin, is, that
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:107782:162"/>we do not all that we are able to do, by means of the impreſſion we have towards him who includes all Goods: For we can do nothing but by the power that we receive from our Union with him who does all things in us. Now, what chiefly makes us Sin, is, becauſe we chooſe rather to enjoy than to examine, becauſe of the Pleaſure we feel in enjoying, and the Pain we find in examining: We ceaſe to make uſe of the motion that is given us to enquire after Good and examine it, and we ſtop in the enjoyment of ſuch things as we ought only to make uſe of. But if we narrowly obſerve, we ſhall ſee there is nothing real on our part, but a defect and ceſſation from enquiry; which, if we may ſo ſay, corrupts the action of God in us; but which however cannot deſtroy it. Thus, What do we when we do not Sin? We do then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God does in us; for we limit not to a particular, or rather to a falſe Good, the love that God imprints on us for the true Good. And, when we Sin, what do we? Nothing; for we love a falſe Good, that God enclines us not to love by an invincible Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We ceaſe to ſeek the true Good, and make uſeleſs the motion which God imprints on us. Now, when we love any particular Good only, or againſt Order, we receive from God as great an impreſſion of Love, as if we ſtopt not at this Good. Moreover, this particular determination, which is neither neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated nor invincible, is alſo given us of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we Sin, we produce no new modification in our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>However, I confeſs, when we do not Sin, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Temptation, we may ſay in one Senſe, that we give our ſelves a new modification, becauſe we would think of other things than on the falſe Goods which tempt us. But what we then do is produced by the action which God impreſſes on us, that is, by our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards Good in general, or by our Will aſſiſted by Grace, or illuminated by a light, or impelled by a preingaged Pleaſure: For in ſhort, if 'tis pretended, that to Will different things, is to give our ſelves dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Modifications, I grant that in this Senſe the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:107782:163"/>Mind can diverſly modifie it ſelf, by the action it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from God.</p>
                     <p>But it muſt always be obſerved, that that action that God performs in us, depends upon us, and is not invincible in reſpect to particular Goods. For when a particular Good is preſented to us, we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senſation of our liberty in reſpect to it, as we have of our Pleaſure and Pain when we feel it. We are even convinced of our Freedom, by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we are convinced of our Exiſtence; for 'tis the internal Senſation we have of our Thoughts, which teaches us that we are. And if in the time that we are conſcious of our liberty in reſpect to a particular Good, we ought to doubt whether or no we are free, becauſe we have no clear Idea of our liberty: We muſt alſo doubt of our Pain, and Exiſtence, at the time even when we are very unhappy, ſince we have no clear Idea, either of our Souls, or of our Pain.</p>
                     <p>It is not the ſame with internal Senſation, as with our external Senſes: Theſe always deceive us in ſomething, when we follow their information; but our internal Senſation never deceives us. 'Tis by my external Senſes, that I ſee Colours upon the ſurface of Bodies, that I hear ſounds in the Air, and feel pain in my Hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I am deceiv'd, if I judge of theſe things upon the relation of my Senſes. But 'tis by internal Senſation that I ſee Colours, hear Sounds, ſuffer Pain: and I deceive not my ſelf, to think I ſee when I ſee, hear when I hear, or ſuffer when I ſuffer, provided I ſtay there. I explain not theſe things more at large, becauſe they are evident of 'emſelves. Thus having an internal Senſation of our liberty, at the ſame time that a particular Good preſents it ſelf to our Mind, we ought not to doubt, whether we are free in reſpect to this Good. Yet, as we have not always this internal Senſation, and ſometimes only conſult what remains of it in our memory after a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed manner; We may think of the abſtracted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which hinder us from feeling our ſelves perſuaded that it is not poſſible for Man to be free: Like a <hi>Stoic,</hi> that wants nothing, and who can Philoſophiſe at his
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:107782:163"/>eaſe, can imagine that Pain is not an Evil, becauſe the internal Senſation he has of it, does not actually convince him of the contrary. He may prove as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> has done, by Reaſons that in one Senſe are true, that 'tis even a contradiction that a wiſe Man can be unhappy.</p>
                     <p>Yet when the internal Senſation we have of our ſelves, will not ſuffice to convince us that we are free, we may perſwade our ſelves of it by Reaſon. For being convinced by Reaſon that God only acts for himſelf, and that he cannot give us any motion which tends not towards him; the impreſſion towards good in general may be invincible, but it is plain the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion he gives us towards particular Goods, muſt neceſſarily be free. For if this impreſſion was invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, we ſhould not have any motion to go to God, altho' he gives us motion only for himſelf; and we ſhould be neceſſitated to ſtop at particular Goods, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>God, Order</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> forbid it. So that we ſhould not Sin through our own default, and God would be truly the cauſe of our Irregularities, ſince they would not be free, but purely natural, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Thus although we ſhould not be convinced of our liberty by the internal Senſation we have of our ſelves, we might by Reaſon diſcover that its neceſſary that Man ſhould be created free; ſuppoſing that he be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of deſiring particular Goods, and that he can deſire theſe Goods, only by the impreſſion or motion that God continually gives him for himſelf, which may likewiſe be proved by Reaſon. But 'tis not the ſame of the capacity we have of ſuffering any Pain. To diſcover that we have this capacity, there is no other way, but internal Senſation; and yet no one doubts but Man is ſubject to Pain.</p>
                     <p>As we know not our Soul by a clear Idea, as I have elſewhere explained, 'twould be in vain for us to try to diſcover what it is in us, which terminates the action that God imprints on us; or what it is in us which is overcome by a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:107782:164"/>that is not invincible, and that may be changed by our Will, or impreſſion towards whatever is good, and by its union with him, who includes the Ideas of all Beings. For, as we have no clear Idea of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of our Soul, there is only an internal Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which teaches us that we exiſt, and what we are, 'Tis this Senſation therefore that we muſt conſult to convince our ſelves that we are free. It anſwers us clearly enough, when we actually propoſe any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good to our ſelves: For there is no Man who can doubt that he is not invincibly carried to Eat a Fruit, or to ſhun ſome inconſiderable Pain; But if inſtead of hearkning to our internal Senſation, we give attention to abſtracted Reaſons, which divert us from thinking of our ſelves, it may be we might even loſe the ſight of our ſelves, and forget what we are: and that endeavouring to reconcile the knowledge of God, and the abſolute power he has over us, with our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, we ſhould fall into an Error, which would overthrow all the Principles of Religion and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>Here is an Objection that is uſed to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what I have ſaid; and although it be very trivial, it nevertheleſs is a difficulty to ſome Men. The hatred of God, ſay they, is an action wherein there is no Good. Therefore it is perfectly the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and God has no part in it: Conſequently Man acts, and gives himſelf a new modification, by an action which proceeds not from God.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, That Sinners hate God only becauſe they freely and falſly judge that he is Evil: For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hate Good, conſidered as ſuch. So that 'tis by the ſame motion of love that God imprints on them to Good, that they Hate him. Now they judge, that God is not Good, becauſe they make not that uſe as they ought of their liberty. Not being convinced by an undoubted evidence, that God is not Good, they ought not to believe him Evil, nor conſequently Hate him.</p>
                     <p>We muſt diſtinguiſh two things in Hatred, the Senſation of the Soul, and motion of the Will. The
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:107782:164"/>Senſation cannot be bad: For 'tis a modification of the Soul, which Morally ſpeaking, has neither Good nor Ill in it. For the motion it is not ill neither, ſince it is not diſtinct from that of Love. For external Evil, being only a privation of Good, it is evident that to fly Evil, is to fly the privation of Good, that is to incline towards Good. So that whatever there is of real and poſitive in the Hatred even of God, hath nothing bad in it: And the Sinner cannot hate God, but by making an abominable abuſe of the action that God continually gives him to induce him to love himſelf.</p>

                        <hi>God cauſes whatever we have that is real in the Senſations of Concupiſcence;</hi>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>and yet he is not the Author of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the difficulties that are raiſed about Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence have much relation to thoſe things I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, it will be proper for me here to ſhow that God is not the Author of Concupiſcence, altho' he performs all things in us; and 'tis only he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces even ſenſible Pleaſures in us.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems undoubted to me that we ought to grant, for the Reaſons I have given in the fifth Chapter of the firſt Book of the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> and elſewhere, that following the Natural Laws of the union of the Soul and Body, Man even before Sin, was carried by a foreſight of Pleaſure to the uſe of ſenſible Goods, and that every time that certain traces were formed in the chief part of his Brain, certain thoughts were produced in his Mind. Now, theſe Laws were very juſt for the Reaſons brought in the ſame Chapter. This ſuppoſed, as before the Fall all things were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well regulated, ſo Man had neceſſarily a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his Body, that he cou'd hinder the formation of theſe traces when he wou'd; for order requires, that the Mind ſhou'd govern the Body. Now this power of Mans Mind over his Body, conſiſted ſtrictly in that according to his deſires and different applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:107782:165"/>he could ſtop the communication of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were produced in his Body by thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that were about him, over which his Will had not an immediate and direct power, as it had over his own Body. I dont ſee how we can conceive, that after any other manner, he coud hinder the traces from being formed in his Brain. Thus the Will of God, or general Law of Nature, which is the true cauſe of the communication of Motion, wou'd on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain occaſions depend upon <hi>Adams</hi> Will; for God had this reſpect for him, that he produced not new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his Body, if he conſented not to them, or at leaſt in the chief part of it, to which the Soul is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately united.</p>
                     <p>Such was the Inſtitution of Nature before Sin; Order requires it ſo; and conſequently, he whoſe Will is ever conformable to Order. Now this Will continuing always the ſame, the Sin of the firſt Man has overturn'd the Order of Nature, becauſe the firſt Man having Sinned, Order woud not permit him abſolutely to rule over any thing.<note place="margin">In the Objection of the 7th Article of the Explanation of the 7th Cap. of the 2d l.; I explain what I ſpeak here in general of the loſs that Man ſuſtain'd as to the power he had over his Body.</note> It is not juſt that the Sinner ſhoud ſuſpend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Motions; that the Will of God ſhou'd be accommodated to his; and that in favour of him, there ſhoud be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in the Law of Nature. So that Man is ſubject to Concupiſcence; his Mind depends upon his Body; he feels in himſelf indeliberate Pleaſures, and involuntary and rebellious Motions, in conſequence of his moſt Juſt Law who united both parts of which he is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>formal</hi> Concupiſcence, as well as <hi>formal</hi> Sin, is nothing real; It is in Man only, the loſs of that power he had of ſuſpending the communication of Motions on certain occaſions: We muſt not admit in God a poſitive Will of producing it. This loſs that Man has ſuſtained, is not a Natural conſequence of the Will of God, which is ever conformable to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and always the ſame; 'tis a conſequence of Sin which has made Man unworthy of an advantage due
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:107782:165"/>only to his Innocence and Juſtice. So that we muſt ſay, that God is not the cauſe of Concupiſcence, but only Sin.</p>
                     <p>Yet whatever is real and poſitive in the Senſations and Motions of Concupiſcence, is performed by God;<note place="margin">

                     <p>I know very well, that we ſay Sin is the cauſe of certain Pleaſures; we ſay it, but do we know it? Can we think that Sin, which is nothing, ſhou'd actually produce ſomething? Can we conceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be a Cauſe? However, we ſay it, but it may be the reaſon is, becauſe we will not take pains e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to think ſeriouſly upon what we ſay; or elſe it is, becauſe we will begin an Explication which is contrary to what we have heard perſons ſay, who, it may be, ſpoke with more Gravity and Aſſurance, than Reflexion and Underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Sin is the cauſe of Concupiſcence, but it is not the cauſe of Pleaſure; as Free-will is the cauſe of Sin, without being the cauſe of the Natural Motion of the Soul. The pleaſure of the Soul is good, as well as its motion or love; and there is nothing good that God does not. The rebellion of the Body, and malignity of Pleaſure, proceeds from Sin, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Soul to, or its acquieſcence in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good, comes from the Sinner: But theſe are only privations and nothings that the Creature is capable of.</p>
                     <p>All Pleaſure is good, and even in ſome manner makes him happy that enjoys it, at leaſt whileſt he enjoys it. But we may ſay that Pleaſure is Evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe inſtead of raiſing the Mind to him that cauſes it, it happens through the errour of our Mind, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Heart, that it abaſes it towards ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects which ſeem to cauſe it.</p>

                     <p>It is Evil, in as much as it is Injuſtice in us who are Sinners, and conſequently deſerve to be puniſh'd rather than rewarded, to oblige God in purſuance of his Primitive Will, to recompence us with agreeable Senſations. In a word, for I will not repeat here what I have already ſaid, it is Evil becauſe God now forbids it; ſince it alienates the Mind from him for whom it was made and preſerv'd: for that which God ordain'd to preſerve the Righteous Man in his Innocence, now eſtabliſhes the Wicked Man in his Sin, and the Senſations of Pleaſure which he wiſely ordain'd as the eaſieſt and moſt obvious expedient to teach Man, without diverting his Reaſon from his true Good, whether he ought to unite himſelf with the Bodies about him; theſe Senſations, I ſay, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, fill the Capacity of his Mind, and fix him on Objects incapable of acting, and infinitely below him, becauſe he looks upon theſe Objects to be the true Cauſes of the Happineſs he occaſionally enjoys from them.</p>

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:107782:167"/>us, the ſaid Idea is the more preſent and clear, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as our deſire is ſtronger, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Senſations we receive by the Body, are weaker and leſs ſenſible, as I have already obſerv'd in the preceding Remark.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in ſaying, that the Will commands the Underſtanding to preſent ſome particular Object to it, I only meant, that the Soul which would conſider that Object with attention, draws near unto it by its deſire; becauſe this deſire, purſuant to the efficacious Will of God, which is the inviolable Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the cauſe of the preſence and clearneſs of the Idea which repreſents that Object. I could not expreſs my ſelf otherwiſe, nor explain my ſelf as I do now; ſince I had not as yet proved, that God alone is the Author of our Ideas, and that our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Wills are the Occaſional Cauſes of it. I ſpoke according to the common Opinion, and I have often been forced ſo to do, becauſe all things cannot be ſaid at one and the ſame time. Readers muſt have Equity, and truſt for ſome time, in order to be ſatisfied; for none but Geometricians can always pay in ready Coin.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>VVHen I ſay that we have no Ideas of the Myſteries of Faith,<note place="margin">Ne omnino taceremus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogati, quid tres, cum tres eſſe fateamur.

                        </note> it is viſible by what precedes, and what follows, that I ſpeak of the clear Ideas which produce Light and Evidence, and by which we have a <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> of the Object, if I may ſo ſpeak. I grant, for Inſtance, that a Peaſant could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Son of God was made Man, or that there are Three Perſons in the Godhead, unleſs he had ſome Idea of the union of the <hi>Word</hi> with our Humanity, and ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Perſon.</hi> But if thoſe Ideas were clear, we might by applying our ſelves to them, perfectly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thoſe Myſteries, and explain them to others; they would no longer be ineffable Myſteries. The Word <hi>Perſon,</hi> according to <hi>St. Auguſtin,</hi> has been ſpoken of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, not ſo much clearly to explain what they are, as not to be ſilent upon a Myſtery which we are oblig'd to ſpeak of.</p>
                     <p>I ſay here, that we have no Ideas of our Miſteries, as I have ſaid elſewhere, that we have no Ideas of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:107782:168"/>our Soul; becauſe the Idea we have of our Soul is not clear, no more than that of our Myſteries. Thus this Word <hi>Idea</hi> is Equivocal: I have ſometimes taken it, for whatever repreſents to the Mind any Object whether clearly or confuſedly. I have taken it, yet more generally for whatever is the immediate Object of the Mind. But I have alſo taken it for that which repreſents things to the Mind in ſo clear a manner, that a Man may diſcover at firſt fight whether ſuch or ſuch Modifications belong to them. Therefore I ſaid ſometimes that we had an Idea of the Soul and ſometimes I have denied it. It is difficult, and often tireſom and diſagreeable, to keep too rigorous an exactneſs in our Expreſſions, ſince it is ſufficient to make our ſelves underſtood.</p>
                     <p>When an Author only contradicts himſelf in the Mind of thoſe who Criticiſe upon him, and who are deſirous he ſhould contradict himſelf, he needs not much value it; and if he ſhould undertake by a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Explanation to ſolve, whatever the malice or ignorance of ſome Perſons might urge againſt him, he would not only make an ill Book; but moreover the Readers would be diſpleaſed at his Anſwers to his Objections, that would be contrary to a certain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity which all Men pretend to. For Men hate to be ſuſpected either of Malice or Ignorance; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Men are not allowed to anſwer weak and malicious Objections, until they are actually made, whereby the Readers are ſecured againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which ſuch Anſwers ſeem to charge thoſe with who exact them.</p>

                     <head>AN EXPLANATION OF Theſe Words of the Firſt Chapter.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>This being granted, we muſt ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Love of God, and to perform his Duty by pre-ingaging Pleaſures; ſeeing that the knowledge he had of his Good, and the Joy which poſſeſſed him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually as a neceſſary conſequence of the proſpect of his happineſs in uniting himſelf to God, might ſuffice to engage him to perform his Duty, and to make him Act with more merit, than if he had been, as it were, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Pre-ingaging Pleaſures.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>TO apprehend all this diſtinctly, it is neceſſary to underſtand, that nothing but knowledge and pleaſure determine Men to Act. For when we begin to love an Object, it is, either becauſe we know by Reaſon that it is good, or becauſe we find by our ſelves that it is agreeable. Now, there is a great deal of difference between Knowledge and Pleaſure: Knowledge enlightens our Mind, and makes us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh good, without inducing us actually and forcibly to love it: Pleaſure on the contrary induces and determines us forcibly to love the Object which ſeems to occaſion it. Knowledge does not induce us of it ſelf; it only makes us freely and of our own accord incline our ſelves towards that Good which it offers us; it leaves us wholly to our ſelves. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the contrary anticipates our Reaſon; it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us from conſulting it; It does not leave us wholly to our ſelves, and it weakens our liberty.</p>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:107782:169"/>
                     <p>Therefore, as <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall had a time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to merit Eternal Happineſs; and in order thereunto a full and abſolute Liberty; and as his Knowledge was ſufficient to keep him ſtrictly united to God, whom he already loved by the Natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or tendency of his Love; he was not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to his Duty by Pre-ingaging Pleaſures, which would have leſſened his Merit in leſſening his Liberty. <hi>Adam</hi> would have had reaſon in ſome meaſure to complain of God, had he hinder'd him from meriting his Reward,<note place="margin">Fortiſſimo quipped dimiſit atque permiſit facere quod vellet. <hi>Aug. de corrupt. &amp; grat. cap. 12.</hi>
                        </note> as he ought to have merited it, that is by Actions perfectly free. God would have injured his free Will in ſome meaſure, in giving him that kind of Grace, which is now only neceſſary for us upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Pre-ingaging Pleaſures of concupiſcence. <hi>Adam</hi> being endued with whatever was neceſſary for his perſeverance, to prevent him would have look'd like a diffidence of his Virtue, and like a reproach of Infidelity. He would have had ſome reaſon to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie himſelf, had he not been ſenſible of the neceſſity he might be liable to, and of the Weakneſs into which he was alſo ſubject to fall. In fine, that which is yet infinitely more conſiderable, is, that it would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Inclinations of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in relation to us,<note place="margin">Look upon the Fifth Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Chriſtian Converſations towards the latter end, <hi>of the Impreſſion of Bruſſels.</hi>
                        </note> indifferent, though it was certainly his firſt and greateſt deſign, who ſuffered Men to be involved in Sin in order to ſhew Mercy to them all in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to the end that he who glories ſhould only glory in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is evident to me, that <hi>Adam</hi> felt no Pre-ingaging Pleaſure in his Duty; but I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it is not altogether certain that he felt Joy, though I ſuppoſe it in this place, becauſe I think it very probable. But to explain my ſelf,</p>
                     <p>There is this difference between Pre-ingaging Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the Pleaſure of Joy, that the firſt antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates Reaſon, and the latter follows it; for Joy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſults from the knowledge we have of our
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:107782:169"/>Happineſs, or of our Perfections, ſince we can never look upon our ſelves as happy or perfect, without being immediately joyful at it. As we may be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our Happineſs by Pleaſure, or diſcover it by Reaſon; ſo there are two ſorts of Joy. But I do not ſpeak in this place of that which is purely ſenſible: I ſpeak of that which <hi>Adam</hi> could feel, <hi>as a neceſſary conſequence of the knowledge he had of his happineſs in uniting himſelf to God.</hi> And there is ſome reaſon to queſtion whether he really had that Joy.</p>
                     <p>The chief is, that this Joy might have taken up his Mind to that degree, as to deprive him of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and would have united him to God after an invincible manner. For we may believe, that as this Joy muſt be proportionable to the happineſs <hi>Adam</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, it muſt needs be exceſſive.</p>
                     <p>But I anſwer to this, firſt, That the Joy which is purely Intelectual leaves the Mind abſolutely free, and has but little influence over its capacity, thinking therein it differs from ſenſible Joy, which commonly diſturbs our Reaſon, and leſſens our Liberty.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer in the ſecond place, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the firſt inſtant of his Creation, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a full and entire poſſeſſion of ſoveraign Good; he was liable to loſe it, and to become unhappy. His Happineſs chiefly conſiſted in that he felt no pain, and that he was in his favour who was to make him perfectly happy, had he perſevered in his Innocence. Therefore his Joy was not exceſſive; moreover, it was, or ought to have been mix'd with a kind of fear, for he had reaſon to be diffident of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I anſwer, That Joy does not always apply the Mind to the real Cauſe which produced it. As we feel Joy at the ſight of our Perfections, it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to believe that the ſaid ſight occaſions it; for when one thing always follows another, we naturally look on it as one of its Effects. So we look upon our ſelves as the Authors of our preſent Felicity: We have a ſecret Complaiſance in our Natural Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: We love our ſelves: We do not always think on
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:107782:170"/>him who operates in us after an Imperceptible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that <hi>Adam</hi> knew more diſtinctly than the beſt Philoſopher that ever was, that God only was capable to act in him, and to occaſion that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Joy which he felt in himſelf at the ſight of his Happineſs and Perfections: He knew that clearly by the light of Reaſon whenever he applied himſelf to it; but he did not feel it. He felt on the contrary, that the ſaid Joy was a Conſequence of his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and he always felt it, without any application on his part. Therefore that Senſation might induce him to conſider his own Perfections, and to delight in himſelf, in caſe he forgot, or any wiſe loſt the ſight of him whoſe Operations are not ſenſible. So that Joy was ſo far from rendring him <hi>Impeccable,</hi> as it is pretended, that on the contrary his Joy perhaps proved the occaſion of his Pride and Ruin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay in this Chapter, that it behov'd <hi>Adam</hi> to take care, <hi>not to ſuffer the Capacity of his Mind to be filld with a preſumptuous Joy excited in his Soul upon the ſight of his Natural Perfections.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Where I ſay,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the Pre-ingaging Delectation is the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THough I ſay in this Chapter, that the Pre-ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Delectation is the Grace which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has particularly merited for us, and in another place I call it abſolutely the Grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> it is not that there is no other Grace but that, or that there is any which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has not purchaſed for us: But I call it the Grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from the Grace that God gave to the firſt Man when he Created him, which is commonly call'd the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Grace. For the Grace, by which <hi>Adam</hi> might have preſerved, his Innocence, was chiefly a Grace of Light, as I have explained in the preceding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; becauſe that <hi>Adam</hi> having no concupiſcence, he ſtood in need of no Pre-ingaging Pleaſures to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it.</p>
                     <p>But the Grace which we now ſtand in need of to keep us within the bounds of our Duty, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and maintain Charity in us, is Pre-ingaging Delectation. For as Pleaſure produces and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Love of thoſe things which occaſion it, or ſeem to occaſion it; the Pre-ingaging Pleaſures we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in relation to our Bodies produce and maintain Cupidity in us. So that being directly contrary to Charity, unleſs God were pleaſed to produce and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:107782:171"/>maintain Charity in us by Pre-ingaging Delectations; it is plain that the Pre-ingaging Pleaſures of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence would weaken it proportionably as Cupidity ſhould be ſtrengthned.</p>
                     <p>What I ſay here, ſuppoſes that God permits our Concupiſcence to Act in us, and that he does not weaken it by inſpiring us with horror againſt all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects, which as a reſult of Sin muſt needs tempt us. I ſpeak of things as they commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. But, ſuppoſing that God diminiſhes Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence inſtead of increaſing the Delectation of Grace, that may produce the ſame Effects. We are ſenſible that there are two ways of putting Scales in <hi>Equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio,</hi> when one of them is over-charged; not only in adding Weights to the other ſide to even it; but alſo in removing ſome of the other weights which bear it down.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I pretend that Men can do no good Actions without Pre-ingaging Delectation. I have ſufficiently explained my ſelf upon that ſubject in the 4th Chapter of the 3d Book. And it appears ſo evident to me, that a Man who has the Love of God in his Heart, may by the force of his Love, and without Pre-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Delectation, give, for Example a Penny to the Poor, or bear ſome ſmall injury with patience; that I can not apprehend how any body can queſtion it. In my opinion Delectation is only neceſſary when the Temptation is Strong, or Love Weak: If however it may be ſaid, that it is abſolutely neceſſary to a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man, whoſe Faith I think may be firm enough, and his Hopes ſtrong enough to overcome great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations; The joy or fore-taſt of Eternal Happineſs being capable to reſiſt the ſenſible Charms of Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>It is true that Delectation or Actual Grace is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all good Actions, if by the Word Delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Grace is underſtood Charity, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> commonly takes it; for it is evident, that what ever is not done for God, is no wiſe good. But removing the Equivocation, and taking the Word Delectation in my ſenſe, I do not think any body can queſtion what I have ſaid.</p>
                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:107782:171"/>
                     <p>But this is the Caſe. It is ſuppoſed that Pleaſure and Love are one and the ſame thing, becauſe the one ſeldom goes without the other; and <hi>St. Auguſtin</hi> does not always diſtinguiſh them. And this being ſuppoſed Men are in the right in ſaying what they ſay. We may conclude with <hi>St. Auſtin; Quod amplius nos delectat, ſecundum id operemur neceſſe eſt;</hi> for Men certainly Will that which they Love; and we may alſo ſay, that we can do nothing good or meritorious without Delectation or without Charity. But I hope to ſhew in an Explanation I ſhall give upon the Treatiſe of the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> that there is as much difference betwixt Pleaſure and Deliberate or Indeliberate Love, as there is betwixt our Knowledge and our Love; or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that difference ſenſibly, as there is between the Figure of a Body and its Motion.</p>

                        <hi>AN EXPLANATION OF</hi> What I have ſaid at the beginning of the <hi>10th</hi> Chapter of the Firſt Book, and in the <hi>6th</hi> of the Second Book, of Method: <hi>That it is very difficult to prove that there are Bodies.</hi> Which muſt be underſtood of the the Proofs that are alledged of their Exiſtence.</head>
                     <p>IT is very uſual among Men to be perfectly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what they think they underſtand beſt, and to underſtand certain things pretty well, which they fancy they have not ſo much as Ideas of. When their Senſes have ſome ſhare in their Judgments, they yield to what they do not apprehend, or to things they have but a very imperfect knowledge of; and when their Ideas are purely Intellectual (I deſire the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions may be allowed me) they unwilling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Indiſputable Demonſtrations.</p>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:107782:172"/>
                     <p>For Example, What can the generality of Men think, when the major part of Metaphyſical Truths are proved to them; When the Exiſtence of God is demonſtrated to them, the Power of his Will, the Immutability of his Decrees; That there is but one God, or one real Cauſe which does all in all things; That there is but one ſoveraign Reaſon, of which all Intelligences participate; That there is but one neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Love, which is the Principle of all Created Wills? They think Men ſpeak Words abſolutely void of Senſe, that they have no Ideas of the things they advance, and that they would do well to hold their Tongues. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical Truths and Proofs having nothing that is ſenſible in them, Men are not moved, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not convinced by them. Nevertheleſs it is moſt certain, that abſtracted things are the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and Metaphyſical Truths are the cleareſt and the moſt evident.</p>
                     <p>Men ſay ſometimes that they have no Ideas of God, and that they have no knowledge of his Will; and moreover think often as they ſay; but 'tis only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fancy they do not know that, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they know beſt. For where is the Man who he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitates to anſwer, when he is ask'd, Whether God is Wiſe, Juſt, Powerful; whether he is, or is not Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, Diviſible, Moveable, Lyable to any Alteration? Nevertheleſs it is impoſſible to anſwer without fear of being deceived, whether certain qualifications agree not to a ſubject, if one has no Ideas of that ſubject. So likewiſe, Where is the Man who dares ſay, that God does not Act by the Plaineſt Means; That he is Irregular in his Deſigns; That he makes Monſters by a poſitive, direct, and particular Will, and not by a kind of neceſſity; In a Word, That his Will is, or may be contrary to the Order, of which there is no Man but has ſome knowledge? But if we had no Idea of the Will of God, we might at leaſt queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he acts according to certain Laws, which we clearly conceive he muſt follow, ſuppoſing he will Act.</p>
                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:107782:172"/>
                     <p>Therefore Men have Ideas of things that are purely Intelligible; and theſe Ideas are much clearer than thoſe of ſenſible Objects. Men are more certain of the Exiſtence of God, than of Bodies; and when they look within themſelves, they diſcover more clearly certain Wills of God, according to which he preſerves all Beings, than thoſe of their beſt Friends, or of thoſe whom they have ſtudy'd all their life. For that Union of their Mind with God, and of their Will with his, I mean with the Eternal Law, or with the Immutable Order, is an immediate, direct, and neceſſary Union; and the union they have with ſenſible Objects, being only Eſtabliſh'd for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Health and Life, it only makes them know thoſe Objects according to the relation they have to that deſign.</p>
                     <p>It is this immediate and direct Union, which is only known, ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> by thoſe whoſe Mind is purified, which enlightens us in the moſt ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of our Reaſon, and exhorts and moves us, in the moſt inward part of our Heart. 'Tis this which teaches us what God Thinks, and even what God Wills; that is, his Eternal Truths and Laws; for no body can queſtion our knowing ſome of them evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently. But the union we have with our beſt Friends does not teach us evidently, either what they think, or what they will. We think we know it perfectly; but we are commonly miſtaken, when we only know it becauſe they tell it us.</p>
                     <p>The Union we have by our Senſes with Bodies which ſurround us, cannot inform us neither; For the relation of the Senſes is never abſolutely true, nay, it is often falſe in all reſpects, according as I have explained it in this Book. And therefore I ſay, that it is more difficult than Men think, to prove poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that there are Bodies, notwithſtanding our Senſes aſſure us there are; becauſe Reaſon does not aſſure us of it ſo poſitively as we imagine, and becauſe it is neceſſary to conſult it with great application to be ſatisfied in it.</p>

                     <p>But as Men are more ſenſible than, reaſonable, and hearken more willingly to the Teſtimony of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, than to that of internal Truth; they have always conſulted their Eyes to aſſure themſelves of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of Matter, without giving themſelves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conſult their Reaſon: And therefore they are ſurpriſed when they are told that it is difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it. They think it is ſufficient to open their Eyes to ſee that there are Bodies; and in caſe there is any fear of being deluded, they think it ſufficient, to draw near and to touch them; after which, they can hardly conceive there can be any reaſon to doubt of their Exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>But our Eyes repreſent Colours to us upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of Bodies, and Light in the Air and in the Sun: Our Ears convey Sounds to us, as being diſpers'd thrô the Air, and Bodies which reverberate the Eccho: And if we credit the Relation of the other Senſes, Heat will be in Fire, Sweetneſs in Sugar, Odor in Musk, and all ſenſible qualities in the Bodies which ſeem to exhale or to diſperſe them. Nevertheleſs it is certain, by the Reaſons I have alledg'd in the firſt Book of <hi>The Search after Truth,</hi> That all thoſe Qualifications are not out of the Soul which feels them; at leaſt, it is not evident that they are in the Bodies which ſurround us. Why then ſhould we conclude, on the bare Relation of the Senſes, which deceive us on all occaſions, that there are indeed external Bodies, and even that theſe Bodies are like unto thoſe we ſee, I mean thoſe which are the immediate Object of our Soul, when we look upon any with the Eyes of our Body. Certainly this is not without its difficulty, what ever men may ſay of it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if we may aſſure our ſelves of the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of any Body by the bare Relation of our Senſes, it is particularly of that to which our Soul is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately united. The moſt lively Senſation, and that which ſeems to have the moſt neceſſary Relation to any Body actually exiſting, is Pain. Nevertheleſs, it happens often, that thoſe who have loſt an Arm, feel violent Pains in it, even long after its Amputation. They are very ſenſible that they have loſt it, when they conſult
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:107782:173"/>their Memory, or look upon their Body; but the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Pain deceives them. And if, as it ſometimes comes to paſs, one ſhould ſuppoſe their abſolutely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Remembrance of what they have been, and their retaining no other Senſe, but that by which they feel a Pain in their imaginary Arm; certainly they could never perſuade themſelves that they have not an Arm, in which they feel ſuch cruel Pains.</p>
                     <p>There have been Men who fancied they had Horns upon their heads; others who believed themſelves to be Butter, or Glaſs; or that their Body was not form'd like other Men; that it was like that of a Cock, of a Woolf, of an Ox. It will be urg'd that they were mad, and I grant it. But their Soul might be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in thoſe things; and conſequently all Men may fall into the like Errors, if they judge of things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Relation of their Senſes. For it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that thoſe Mad-men really behold themſelves as they fancy they are: The Error is not preciſely in the Sentiment they have, but in the Judgment they form; for if they did ſay barely that they feel, or behold themſelves like a Cock, they would not be deceived. They are only deceived in believing that their Body is like unto that which they feel, I mean, to that which is the immediate Object of their Mind, when they conſider themſelves. Thus thoſe who believe they are ſuch as they really are, are no more judicious than Mad-men in the judgment they form of themſelves, if they only judge barely according to the Relation of their Senſes. It is not by Reaſon, but good Fortune, they are not deceiv'd.</p>
                     <p>But at the bottom, how can we be certain, whether thoſe who are called Mad-men, are really ſo? Might not one ſay, that they only ſeem to be mad, becauſe they have particular Sentiments? For it is evident that a Man is look'd upon as a Mad-man, not becauſe he ſees that which is not; but becauſe he ſees the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: of what others ſee, whether others are deceived or not.</p>
                     <p>A Peaſant's eyes, for inſtance, are diſpoſed in ſuch a manner, that he ſees the Moon ſuch as ſhe really is,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:107782:174"/>or ſuch only as ſhe is ſeen,<note place="margin">We partly ſee thoſe things when we behold the Moon through a Teleſcope.</note> or perhaps as ſhe will be ſeen at ſome time or other with Proſpectives of a new Invention: He looks upon her with Admiration, and cries out to his companions, What huge Mountains do I ſee what deep Valleys, what Seas, what Lakes, what Gulphs, what Rocks! Do you not ſee many Seas to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, and that there is hardly any thing but Lands and Mountains towards the Weſt and South? Do you not behold a Mountain on that very ſide, much higher than any of thoſe we have ever ſeen; and do you not admire a perfect black Sea, or a horrid Whirl pool, in the centre of that Planet? What will his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions anſwer to ſuch Exclamations, and what will they think of him? That he is a Mad-man, who has been diſtemper'd by the malignant Influences of the Planet which he admires and conſiders. He is alone of that opinion, and that is ſufficient. Thus, to be mad in the opinion of others, it is not neceſſary to be ſo effectively; it is ſufficient to think, or to ſee things otherwiſe than they do: For ſhould all Men fancy themſelves to be Cocks, he that ſhould think himſelf to be what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is, would certainly be lookt upon as a Mad-man.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps ſome will ask, whether Men have a Bill at the end of their Noſe, and a Cock's-comb upon their head? I ſuppoſe not. But I know nothing of it, when I only judge by my Senſes, and know not how to make that uſe of them which I ought to do, let me feel my Face and my Head never ſo much. I only feel my Body, and thoſe which ſurround me, with hands of which I neither know the length nor figure: I do not ſo much as know certainly that I have hands; I only know it while I think I ſtir them. There are certain Motions in a certain part of my Brain, which, according to the general opinion, is the Seat of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe; but perhaps I want that very part which people ſpeak ſo much of, and which is ſo little known; at leaſt, I do not feel it in my ſelf, though I feel my hands: So that I have yet more reaſon to believe I have hands, than that little <hi>Glandula pinealis</hi> which Men ſtill daily diſpute about. But in fine, I neither know the figure not the motions of that little <hi>Gland;</hi> and yet
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:107782:174"/>I am told, That that only can inſtruct me in the figure and motion of my Body, and of thoſe which ſurround me.</p>
                     <p>What then are we oblig'd to think of all this? That it is not the Body which inſtructs Reaſon; That the part to which the Soul is immediately united, is neither viſible nor intelligible of it ſelf; That neither our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor thoſe that are about it, can be the immediate Object of our Mind; That we cannot learn from our Brain, whether it actually exiſts, and much leſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there are Bodies that ſurround us. That for that Reaſon we are oblig'd to acknowledge that there is ſome ſuperiour Intelligence which alone is capable of acting in us; and which may act after ſuch a manner in us, as truly to repreſent external Bodies to us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving us the leaſt Idea of our Brain; though the Motions which are produced in our Brain, are an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it to diſcover thoſe Bodies to us. For in fine, we ſee, with eyes whoſe figure we know not, how the Bodies which ſurround us are figured: And though the Colours which appear upon Objects are not more lively than thoſe which are painted upon the Optick Nerve, we do not in the leaſt ſee theſe, even while we admire the beauty of the others.</p>
                     <p>But after all, what obligation lyes on that Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to ſhew us Bodies, when our Brain has certain motions? or what neceſſity is there of external Bodies to excite motions in our Brain? Do not Sleep, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Folly, produce thoſe motions without the help of thoſe external Bodies? Is it evident that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which cannot move each other,<note place="margin">n="*" See the <hi>3d</hi> Chap. of the <hi>2d</hi> part of the <hi>6</hi> Book, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation on the ſaid Chapter.</note> ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to thoſe they meet a moving force which they have not in themſelves? Yet allowing that Bodies move themſelves, and thoſe they hit againſt; ſhall not he who gives a Being to all things, be able of him ſelf to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in our Brain thoſe motions to which the Ideas of our Mind are affix'd? In fine, where is the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, That our Brain being without new motions, our Soul ſhould nevertheleſs have new Ideas; ſince it is certain that the motions of the Brain do not produce the Ideas of the Soul; that we have not ſo much as a
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:107782:175"/>knowledge of thoſe Motions; and that God only can repreſent our Ideas to us,<note place="margin">n="†" See the <hi>6.</hi> Chap. of the <hi>2.</hi> part of the <hi>3.</hi> Book, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation on the ſaid Chapter.</note> as I have prov'd elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where? Therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary, to be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively aſſured of the Exiſtence of external Bodies, to know God, who gives us the Senſation of them; and to know, That as he is infinitely perfect, he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us. For if the Intelligence which gives us the Ideas of all things, would, as it were, divert it ſelf in repreſenting Bodies to us as actually exiſtent, though there were none, it is evident that it would not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for it ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>It is for thoſe Reaſons, or the like, that <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> who was deſirous to eſtabliſh his Philoſophy upon a true Foundation, has not thought fit to ſuppoſe that there are Bodies, nor to prove it by ſenſible Demonſtrations, though they appear very convincing to the common ſort of Men. Apparently he knew as well as we do, that it was enough to open our Eyes to ſee Bodies; and that we might draw near unto them, and feel them, to be certain whether our Eyes did not deceive us in their Teſtimony: He was ſufficiently acquainted with the Genius of Men, to be ſenſible that the like Proofs would not be rejected: But he neither matter'd ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Probabilities, nor the vain Applauſes of Men. He preferr'd Truth, though deſpis'd, to the Glory of a Reputation without Merit; and choſe rather to be thought ridiculous by Men of mean Parts, and make ſuch Doubts as ſeem'd extravagant to them, rather than to aſſert things which he did not judge to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and undeniable.</p>
                     <p>But though <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has given the ſtrongeſt Proofs, that Reaſon alone can furniſh, for the Exiſtence of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; though it is evident that God is no Deceiver, and indeed we might ſay that he did actually deceive us, if we deciev'd our ſelves by making a due uſe of our Senſe, and other Faculties, whereof he is the Author: Yet we may ſay that the Exiſtence of Matter is not as yet perfectly demonſtrated. For in fine, in point of Philoſophy, we muſt believe nothing, but what Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence obliges us to believe: We muſt make as much uſe of Liberty as we can: Our Judgments muſt
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:107782:175"/>have no farther Extent than our Perceptions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us only judge that we ſee Bodies, when we ſee them really; and that theſe viſible or intelligible Bodies do actually exiſt: But why ſhould we judge poſitively that there is a material World without, like unto the intelligible World which we ſee.</p>
                     <p>It may be urg'd, perhaps, That we ſee thoſe Bodies without us, and even at a great diſtance from that which we animate; and therefore we may judge that they are without us, without extending our Judgments beyond our Perceptions. Bus what of that? Do not we ſee the Light without us, and in the Sun, though it is not there? Nevertheleſs, I grant that thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which we ſee without us, are really external; for that is undeniable. But is it not evident that there are external Places and Diſtances, That there are intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Spaces in the intelligible World, which is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Object of our Mind? The material Body which we animate, (let us obſerve this) is not that which we ſee, when we look upon it, I mean when we turn our bodily Eyes towards it; the Body which we ſee, is an intelligible Body; and there are intelligible Spaces between that intelligible Body and the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Sun which we ſee, as there are material Spaces between our Body and the Sun which we behold. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God ſees that there are Spaces between the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he has created; but he does not ſee thoſe Bodies or thoſe Spaces by themſelves; he can only ſee them by intelligible Bodies and Spaces. God draws his Light only from himſelf; he only ſees the material World in the intelligible World, which he includes; and in the knowledge he has of his own Will, which actually gives Exiſtence and Motion to all things. Therefore there are intelligible Spaces between the intelligible Bodies which we ſee, as there are material Spaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Bodies we behold.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, we muſt obſerve, That as there is none but God who of himſelf knows his own Will, which produces all Beings; it is impoſſible for us to know from any but himſelf, whether there is really without us a material World like unto that which we ſee: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:107782:176"/>the material World is neither viſible nor intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible of it ſelf. Therefore to be fully convinc'd that there are Bodies, we muſt not not only have Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations that there is a God, and that God is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; but alſo that God has aſſur'd us that he has created ſuch: Which I do not find to be prov'd in <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>'s Works.</p>
                     <p>God only ſpeaks to the Mind, and obliges it to aſſent after two ways; by Evidence, and by Faith. I own that Faith obliges us to believe that there are Bodies; but as to the Evidence, it ſeems to me not to be full, nor are we invincibly induc'd to believe that there is any thing beſides God and our Mind. It is true, we have a great Propenſion to believe that there are Bodies which ſurround us.<note place="margin">Sixth Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</note> I grant it to Mr. <hi>Deſcartes:</hi> But nevertheleſs, as natural as it is, it does not force us to it by Evidence; it only inclines us to it by Impreſſion. Now, we are only oblig'd in our free Judgments to follow Light and Evidence; and if we ſuffer our ſelves to be guided by ſenſible Impreſſion, we ſhall for the moſt part be miſtaken.</p>
                     <p>Why do we deceive our ſelves in the Judgments we form upon ſenſible Qualities, upon the magnitude, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and motion of Bodies; unleſs it be becauſe we follow an Impreſſion, like unto that which induces us to believe that there are Bodies? Do we not ſee that Fire is hot, that Snow is white, that the Sun is dazling with Light? Do we not ſee that ſenſible Qualities as well as Bodies are external? Nevertheleſs it is certain that theſe ſenſible Qualities which we ſee without us, are not really out of us; or rather, there is no certainty in all this. What reaſon have we to judge that beſide the intelligible Bodies which we ſee, there are others which we look upon? What Evidence have we, that an Impreſſion which is deceitful, not only in relation to ſenſible Qualities, but alſo in relation to the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, figure, and motion of Bodies, ſhould not be the ſame in relation to the actual Exiſtence cf Bodies? I ask what Evidence we have of it? For as to Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, I grant that they are not wanting.</p>
                     <pb n="397" facs="tcp:107782:176"/>
                     <p>I know there is this difference between ſenſible Qualities and Bodies, that Reaſon can much eaſier correct the Impreſſion or Natural Judgments which have a relation to ſenſible Qualities, than thoſe which have a relation to the exiſtence of Bodies: And moreover, that all the corrections of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in relation to ſenſible Qualities, agree perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Chriſtian Religion and Morality, and that the Exiſtence of Bodies cannot be denied out of a principle of Religion.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſie to apprehend, that Pleaſure and Pain, Heat, and even Colours are no modifications of Bodies: That ſenſible Qualities in general are not contain'd in the Idea we have of matter; in a word, that our Senſes do not repreſent ſenſible objects to us, as they are in themſelves, but as they relate to the preſeruation of Health and Life. This is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſonant to Reaſon, but much more yet to the Chriſtian Religion and Morality, as have been ſhown in divers parts of this Work.</p>
                     <p>But it is not ſo eaſie to aſſure our ſelves poſitively that there are no Bodies without us, as that Pain and Hear are not in Bodies, which ſeem to cauſe them. It is moſt certain, at leaſt, that there may be external Bodies. We have nothing to prove that there are none, and on the contrary we have a ſtrong inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to believe that there are. Therefore we have more reaſon to conclude that there are ſuch, than to believe that there are not. For which Reaſon, I am of Opinion, that we ought to believe there are. For we are naturally inclin'd to follow our natural Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when we cannot poſitively correct it by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Evidence. For all natural Judgment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God, we may conform our free Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to it, when we find no means to diſcover the falſity of them: And ſhould we deceive our ſelves on thoſe occaſions, the Author of our Mind would ſeem in ſome meaſure to be the Author of our Errors, and Faults.</p>
                     <pb n="398" facs="tcp:107782:177"/>
                     <p>This Argument perhaps is pretty juſt. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we muſt grant that it cannot paſs for an evident demonſtration of the exiſtence of Bodies. For in fine. God does not force us invinſibly to ſubmit to it. If we conſent to it, 'tis freely: and we may chuſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will conſent to it or not. If my Argument is Juſt, we ought to believe that it is altogether probable there are Bodies: but we muſt not remain abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd of it by the ſaid Argument. Otherwiſe 'tis we who act, and not God in us. 'Tis by a free Act, and conſequently liable to Error we conſent, and not by an invinſible Impreſſion: For we believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we will it freely, and not becauſe we ſee it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.</p>
                     <p>Certainly nothing but Faith can convince us that there are Bodies indeed. We can receive no exact demonſtration of the exiſtence of any other Being, but of that which is neceſſary. And, if we examine it ſtrictly, we ſhall find it is not even poſſible to know with an abſolute evidence, whether God is, or is not really Creator of a material and ſenſible World; for ſuch an evidence is only met with in neceſſary rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and there is no neceſſary relation between God, and ſuch a World. He might not have Created it, and if he has done it, 'tis becauſe it was his Will, and his Free-Will too.</p>
                     <p>The Saints which are in Heaven are ſenſible by an evident Light, that the Father begot his Son, and that the Father and the Son produced the Holy Ghoſt; for theſe <hi>Emanations</hi> are neceſſary. But the World not being a neceſſary <hi>Emanation</hi> of God, thoſe who ſee his Being the moſt clearly, do not ſee evidently which are his external productions. Nevertheleſs, I do believe, that the Bleſſed are certain that there is a World: but it is becauſe God aſſures them of it in making his Will known to them after a manner which is unknown to us: And even we here below are certain of it, becauſe Faith teaches us that God has Created this World; and that this Faith is Conſonant to our Natural Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or to our compound Senſations, when they are
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:107782:177"/>confirm'd by all our Senſes, corrected by our Memory, and rectified by our Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>It is true it ſeems at firſt, that the Proof or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our Faith ſuppoſes there are Bodies; <hi>Fides ex auditu.</hi> It ſeems to ſuppoſe Prophets, Apoſtles, Holy Writ, and Miracles. But if we obſerve it ſtrictly, we ſhall find, that though we only ſuppoſe appearances of Men, of Prophets, of Apoſtles, of Holy Writ, of Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What we have learn'd by thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended appearances, is abſolutely undeniable: ſince, as I have prov'd it in divers parts of this Work; God alone can repreſent thoſe pretended appearances to the Mind, and God is no deceiver; for Faith it ſelf ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes all this. Now in the appearance of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Miracles, we learn that God has Created an Heaven and an Earth, that the Word was made Fleſh, and other Truths of this kind, which ſuppoſe the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a Created World. So that it is certain by Faith, that there are Bodies; and thereby all thoſe appearances become Realities. I need not inlarge any farther to anſwer an Objection which appears too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe to the common ſort of Men, and I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that this will ſuffice to ſatisfie all thoſe who are not too difficult.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we muſt conclude from all this, that we can, and even that we ought to correct the Natural Judgments, or compound perceptions which have a relation to ſenſible Qualities, which we attribute to external Bodies, or to that which we animate. But, as to the Natural Judgments that have a relation to the actual Exiſtence of Bodies, though we might abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely forbear forming free Judgments agreeable to them, we ought not to do it, becauſe thoſe Natural Judgments agree perfectly with Faith.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, I have particularly made this Remark, that Men ſhould ſeriouſly reflect upon this Truth: That nothing but Eternal Wiſdom can inlighten us, and that all the ſenſible knowledge, in which our Body has any ſhare, is deceitful; or at leaſt is attended with that Light to which we feel our ſelves oblig'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:107782:178"/>I am ſenſible that the common ſort of Men will not approve theſe Thoughts, and that according to the abundance or defect of their Animal Spirits, they will either laugh or be frightned at theſe Arguments. For the Imagination cannot indure abſtract and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Truths: It either looks upon them as fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spectres, or ridiculous Phantaſms. But I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be expos'd to the raillery of ſtrong and bold Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and to the Indignation and Fear of the weak and timorous, than to be wanting in what I owe to Truth, and to thoſe generous defenders of the Mind againſt the efforts of the Body, who know how to diſtinguiſh the anſwers of illuminating Wiſdom from the confuſed noiſe of a perplexing and ſeducing Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>

                     <head>AN EXPLANATION OF THE Fifth Chapter of the Second Book. <hi>Of Memory, and Spiritual Habits.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Forbear ſpeaking of Memory and Spiritual Habits in this Chapter for ſeveral Reaſons, the chief of which is, that we have no clear Idea of our Soul. For what means have we clearly to explain the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Operations of the Soul leave in it, which diſpoſitions are its Habits, ſince we do hot even clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the Nature of the Soul? It is evident that we cannot diſtinctly know the alterations a Being is capable of, when we do not diſtinctly know the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Being. For, if for inſtance, Men had no clear Idea of extenſion, they would in vain endeavour
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:107782:178"/>to diſcover the Figures of it. However, ſince ſome are deſirous I ſhould ſpeak upon a matter which in it ſelf is not known to me, this is the method, I will obſerve to follow none but clear Idea's in it.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe that God only acts in the Mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Idea's of all things to it; and that when the Mind perceives any Object by a very clear and lively Idea, it is becauſe God repreſents that Idea to it after a very perfect manner.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe, moreover, that the Will of God being abſolutely conſonant to Order and Juſtice, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have a right to a thing to obtain it. Theſe Suppoſitions, which are diſtinctly conceiv'd, being made, the Spiritual Memory explains it ſelf eaſily; for Order requiring that Perſons, who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thought on ſome Object, ſhould the eaſier think on it again, and have a clearer and more lively Idea of it than thoſe who have thought but little on it, the Will of God, which operates continually accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Order, repreſents to their Mind, as ſoon as they deſire it, the clear and lively Idea of that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. So that, according to that Explanation, the Memory, and other Habits of pure Intelligences, conſiſt not in a facility of operation which reſults from certain Modifications of their Being, but from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Order of God, and in a Right which the Mind acquires over thoſe things Which have already been ſubmitted to it; and the ſole power of the Mind depends immediately arid only on God, the force or facility which all Creatures find in their Operations, being in that ſenſe only the Efficacious Will of the Creator.</p>
                     <p>And I do not think we are obliged to abandon this Explanation upon the account of the ill habits of Sinners, and of the Damn'd; for tho' God does whatever is real and poſitive in the Actions of Sinners, it is evident, by what I have ſaid in the firſt Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God is not the Author of Sin.</p>
                     <p>However, I do believe, and think my ſelf oblig'd to believe, that after the action of the Soul, there ſtill remains ſome alterations which do diſpoſe it to
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:107782:179"/>that ſame Action: But as I know them not, I cannot explain them, for I have no clear Idea of my Mind, in which I can diſcover all the Modifications it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. I believe, by Theological Proofs, and not by clear and evident ones,<note place="margin">See the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation on the <hi>7th</hi> Chap. of the <hi>2d</hi> part of the third Book.</note> that the Reaſon for which pure Intelligences ſee Objects which they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conſider'd more clearly than others, is not meerly becauſe God repreſents thoſe Objects to them in a more lively and more perfect manner, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are really better diſpos'd to receive the ſame Action from God in them. Juſt as the facility which ſome perſons have acquir'd to play upon ſome Inſtruments, does not conſiſt in that the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are neceſſary for the Motion of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, have more action, or force in them than in other Men, but that the ways through which the Spirits ſlide, are more ſlippery and ſmoother through the habit of Exerciſe, as I have explain'd in this Chapter. Nevertheleſs I grant, that all the Uſes of Memory, and of the other Habits, are not neceſſary to thoſe, who being perfectly united to God, find in his Light all ſorts of Idea's, and in his Will all the facility to act that they can deſire.</p>

                     <head>AN EXPLANATION OF THE Seventh Chapter of the Second Book.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>The Summary of the Proofs and Explanations I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven about Original Sin; with Anſwers to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that ſeem'd moſt weighty to me.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>TO anſwer thoſe difficulties regularly, which may ariſe in the Mind about Original Sin, and the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:107782:179"/>manner how it is tranſmitted from Father to Son, I think it will be neceſſary to give in few words what I have ſaid upon that Subject in ſeveral parts of the <hi>Search after Truth.</hi> Theſe then are my principal Proofs; I have diſpos'd them in a peculiar manner, to make them the more ſenſible to thoſe who will conſider them.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. God Wills Order in his Works; he Wills what we conceive clearly to be conſonant to Order: And that which we conceive to be clearly contrary to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, God Wills it not. This Truth is evident to all thoſe who can conſider, with a fix'd and pure Sight, the infinitely perfect Being. Nothing can trouble or ſhake them in that; and they clearly ſee that all the difficulties which can be form'd againſt this Principle, only proceeds from the ignorance we have of thoſe things which it would be neceſſary to know in order to reſolve them.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. God has no other end but himſelf in his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Order requires it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. God makes and preſerves the Mind of Man that it might be imploy'd about him, that it ſhould know and love him; for God is the end of his own Works. Order requires it ſo. God cannot Will that we ſhould love that which is not lovely; or rather, God cannot Will, that what is leaſt lovely ſhould be moſt belov'd. Therefore it is evident, that Nature is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and in diſorder, ſince the Mind loves Bodies which are not lovely, and often loves them more than God. Original Sin, or the depravation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore requires no proof, for every one ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently finds within himſelf, a Law which captivates and diſorders him, and a Law which is not eſtabliſh'd by God, ſince it is contrary to the Order which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates his Will.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Nevertheleſs, Man was admoniſh'd before his Fall by preingaging Senſations, and not by a clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:107782:180"/>whether he was to unite himſelf to external Bodies, or to ſeparate from them: Order requires it. It is a diſorder for the Mind to be oblig'd to apply it ſelf to Bodies; it may be united to them, but it is not made for them. Therefore it ought to know God, and be ſenſible of Bodies. Moreover, as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are incapable of being its good, the Mind could not eaſily unite it ſelf to them, if it only knew them as they are, without finding that in them which is not there. Therefore falſe Good muſt be diſcern'd by a preingaging Senſation, to be belov'd by a love of Inſtinct; and the real good muſt be known by a clear knowledge, to be belov'd by a free and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable love. In fine, God makes and preſerves Man that he may know and love him; therefore, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of his Mind muſt not be fill'd, nor even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt his Will, by the knowledge of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Figures and Configurations of Bodies which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him, nor of that which he animates. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in order to know by a clear knowledge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a Fruit, at ſuch a time, is fit for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Body, we muſt apparently know ſo many Things, and form ſo many Ratiocinations, that the moſt extended Mind would be wholly taken up by it.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. But, tho' the firſt Man had notice by preingaging Senſations, whether he was or was not to make uſe of external Bodies, yet he was not agitated by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary or Rebel Motions; yea, he blotted out of his Mind the Idea's of ſenſible Objects, when he pleas'd, whether he us'd or us'd them not, for ſo Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der requires. The Mind may be united to the Body, but it muſt have no dependance on it; it muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it. Moreover, all the love God puts in us muſt centre in him, for God produces nothing in us but for himſelf. Finally, Bodies are not lovely; they are below that which is in us capable of loving. Therefore, in the firſt Inſtitution of Nature, Bodies could not turn our Mind towards them, or incline it to conſider or love them as its Goods.</p>
                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:107782:180"/>
                     <p n="6">VI. External Bodies never act in our Soul, but when they produce ſome Motions in our Body, and when thoſe Motions communicate themſelves to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Brain; for it is according to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations which happen in that part of the Brain, that the Soul changes it ſelf, and finds it ſelf agitated by ſenſible Objects. I have ſufficiently prov'd it, and Experience demonſtrates it. This being granted, it is clear, by the precedent Article, that the firſt Man, when he pleas'd, ſtopp'd the motions communicated to his Body, or at leaſt thoſe which were communicated to the principal part of his Brain: Order would have it ſo; and conſequently, he whoſe Will is always conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Order, and can do nothing againſt Order al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' it be Almighty. Thus Man had the power, on ſome occaſions, to ſuſpend the Natural Law of the Communication of Motions, ſince he had no Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, and felt no involuntary and rebellious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. But the firſt Man, by Sin, has loſt that power: Order Wills it ſo; for it were not reaſonable, that in favour of a Sinner and a Rebel, there ſhould be any exceptions in the General Law of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Motions, beſides thoſe which are abſolutely neceſſary for the preſervation of our Life, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society. Therefore the Body of Man, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſhaken by the Action of ſenſible Objects, and his Soul being agitated by all the Motions of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Brain, it is a dependant upon the Body to which it had only been united, and which it did command before the Fall.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Let us now ſee how <hi>Adam</hi> was capable of Sinning It is natural to love Pleaſure and to reliſh it; and that was not forbidden to <hi>Adam.</hi> It is the ſame of Joy; we may lawfully rejoyce at the ſight of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Perfections; that is not ill in it ſelf. Man was made to be happy, and Pleaſure and Joy actually makes us Happy and Contented. The firſt Man then
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:107782:181"/>enjoy'd Pleaſure in the uſe of ſenſible Goods; he alſo rejoyc'd at the ſight of his Perfections; for we cannot conſider our ſelves as being happy or perfect without rejoycing thereat: For tho' he knew that God was his Good, he did nor feel it, as I have prov'd in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places. Therefore the Joy he could find in his Duty was not very ſenſible; which being ſuppos'd, as the firſt Man had not an infinite Capacity of Mind, his Pleaſure, or his Joy, leſſen'd the clear ſight of his Mind, which made him ſenſible that God was his Good, and that he ought to love him only. For Pleaſure is in the Soul, and modifies it. So that it fills the Capacity we have of thinking, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as it affects us and acts in us. This is what we learn by Experience; that is, by the inward Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have of our ſelves. Therefore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the firſt Man, having by degrees ſuffer'd the Capacity of his Mind to be divided, or fill'd up by the lively Senſation of a preſumptuous Joy, or perhaps by ſome love or ſenſible Pleaſure, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and the remembrance of his Duty, were blotted out of his Mind, by his having neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed couragiouſly to follow his light in ſearch of his real Good. Having thus divided his Mind, he was capable of falling, for his principal Grace and Power was his Light, and the clear knowledge of his Duty, ſince then he did not want thoſe preingaging de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectations which we now ſtand in need of to reſiſt Concupiſcence.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. And we muſt obſerve, that neither the preinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Senſations which <hi>Adam</hi> felt in the uſe of the Goods of the Body, nor the Joy which he found in conſidering his Happineſs or Perfection, are the real cauſes of his Fall; for he was ſenſible that God only was capable to make him feel Pleaſure or Joy. Therefore he ought to have lov'd him only, ſince we ought to love nothing but the real cauſe of our Happineſs. As nothing did diſturb the Knowledge and Light of the firſt Man, while he was willing to preſerve it pure; he could, and ought to have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:107782:181"/>out of his Mind, whatever Senſations did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it, and put it into the leaſt danger to forget or loſe the ſight of him who enlighten'd, and ſatisfy'd it. It was his Duty to remember, that if God did not make him feel him as good, but only know him as ſuch, it was that he might the ſooner deſerve his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the continual uſe of his Liberty.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing then that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> Sinn'd, and that in conſequence of their Sin they have felt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves involuntary and rebellious motions: I ſay, it was neceſſary their Children ſhould be Born Sinners, and liable, like them, to the motions of Concupiſcence. Theſe are my Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. I have prov'd at large in the Chapter that occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Diſcourſe, that there is ſuch a communication between the Mothers Brain and her Childs, that all the Motions and Traces which are made in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Brain, are excited in the Childs. Therefore as the Childs Soul is united to its Body in the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is created; becauſe it is the conformation of the Body which obliges God, purſuant of his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Will, to give it a Soul to <hi>inform</hi> it: It is evident, that at the very Inſtant the Soul is created it has cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt inclinations, and is inclin'd towards the Body; ſince from that very moment, it has the inclinations which anſwer to the motions, that are actually in the Brain to which it is united.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. But whereas it is a diſorder that the Mind ſhould incline to Bodies, and love them, the Child is a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in diſorder as ſoon as it is created. God who loves Order hates it in that condition. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs its Sin is not free; 'tis its Mother who has conceiv'd it in Iniquity, upon the account of the communication which is Eſtabliſh'd by the Order of Nature between the Brain of the Mother and that of the Child.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. Now the ſaid communication is very good in its Inſtitution for ſeveral Reaſons: 1. Becauſe it is uſeful,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:107782:182"/>and perhaps neceſſary towards the conformation of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> 2. Becauſe the Child might thereby have ſome commerce with its Parents, for it was reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it ſhould know from whom it deriv'd the Body it animates. Finally, the ſaid communication was the only means by which the Child could know what paſs'd without, and what it ought to think of it. Having a Body, it was reaſonable it ſhould have thoughts that had a relation to it, and that it ſhould not be depriv'd of the ſight of the Works of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which it liv'd. It is very probable, that there are many other Reaſons for the ſaid communication, beſides thoſe I have related; but theſe are ſufficient to juſtify it, and to vindicate the Conduct of him whoſe Will is neceſſarily conformable to Order.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. However, it is not Juſt the Child ſhould receive the Trace of ſenſible Objects forcibly: And if the Soul of Children was created but one moment before its being united to their Bodies, if it were but one moment in a ſtate of Innocence or Order, it would of Right, and by the neceſſity of the Eternal Order, or Law, have a power to ſuſpend the ſaid Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; juſt as the firſt Man before his Fall, had a power to ſtop whenever he pleas'd, the Motions which were excited in him, for Order requires the Body ſhould obey the Mind. But as the Souls of Children never were agreeable to God, there was no reaſon that God ſhould change the Law of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Motions in their behalf; therefore 'tis Juſt that Children ſhould be Born Sinners and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. And the cauſe of their Sin is not the Order of Nature, that Order is Juſt; but it is the Sin of thoſe from whom they derive their Being. In this ſenſe it is not Juſt that a Father, who is a Sinner, ſhould get Children more perfect than himſelf, nor that they ſhould have a power over their Body which their Mother has not over hers.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. I grant, that after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, which corrupts and overthrows all things, God might, in making ſome
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:107782:182"/>alterations in the Order of Nature, have remedy'd the diſorder which the ſaid Fall had caus'd. But God does not change his Will thus; he Wills nothing but what is Juſt. What he Wills once, he Wills it ever; he does not correct himſelf; he does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; he Wills conſtantly; his Eternal Decrees do not depend on the inconſtancy of a Man's Will, it it not Juſt they ſhould be ſubmitted to it.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. But, if it be allowable to penetrate into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of God, and to ſay what we think upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which he may have had to Eſtabliſh the Order I have above-mentioned, and to permit the Fall of the firſt Man, I am of Opinion that it is impoſſible to have Sentiments more worthy of the greatneſs of God, and more conſonant to Religion and Reaſon, than to believe that Gods principal end in his exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Operations, is the Incarnation of his Son:<note place="margin">See the <hi>9th</hi> Dialogue of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note> That God eſtabliſh'd the Order of Nature, and permitted the diſorder which has happen'd in it to favour that great Work; That he permitted all Men to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Sin, that no Man might Glory in himſelf; and that he leaves even Concupiſcence in the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt perfect, that they may have no vain Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in themſelves. For when we conſider the Perfection of our Being,<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>in</hi> Tul. lib. 6. c. 9.</note> it is difficult to deſpiſe our ſelves, unleſs at the ſame time we ſee and love Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Good, in the preſence of which all our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Grandeur vaniſhes in a moment.</p>
                     <p>I own that Concupiſcence may prove the Subject of our Merit, and that it is reaſonable the Mind ſhould, for a time, follow Order difficultly, to deſerve to be Eternally ſubmitted to it with pleaſure. I grant that it may be, upon this account, that God has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Concupiſcence, after having foreſeen Sin. But Concupiſcence not being abſolutely neceſſary to our Meriting, if God permitted it, it was becauſe Man might be able to do no good without the aſſiſtance which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has merited for us, and that he might have no reaſon to Glory in his own power; for it is plain, that Man cannot ſight againſt, and overcome
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:107782:183"/>himſelf, unleſs he be animated by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who, as the Head of the Faithful, inſpires them with ſuch Senſations as are directly oppoſite to the Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence they derive from the firſt Man.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. Suppoſing then that Children are Born with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, it is evident that they are really Sinners, ſince their heart is ſet upon Bodies as much as it is capable. There is as yet but one love in their Will, and that love is irregular. So there is nothing in them that God can love, ſince God cannot love diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. But when they have been Regenerated in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is, when their Heart has been turn'd towards God, either by an actual motion of love, or by an inward diſpoſition, like unto that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after an Act of Loving God, then Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is no longer a Sin in them, for it inhabits no longer alone in the Heart, it has no longer any domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion there: The habitual Love, which remains in them by the Grace of Baptiſm in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or ſtronger than that which is in them by the Concupiſcence they have in <hi>Adam.</hi> They are like the Juſt, who in their Sleep follow the Motions of Luſt, yet loſe not the Grace of Baptiſm, for they do not freely conſent to theſe Motions.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. And it ſhould not be thought ſtrange, if I believe it poſſible for Children while they are Baptizing to love God with a free Love. For, ſince the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is contrary to the firſt, why ſhould he not at the time of Regeneration deliver Children out of the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their Bodies, to which they are only ſubjected by the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo that being enlightned and excited by a lively and effectual Grace to love God; they may love him with a free and reaſonable love, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindered by the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> It is not obſervable, ſome may urge, that their Bodies ceaſes one moment from acting over their Mind. But ſhould Men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their not ſeeing that which is not viſible? That
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:107782:183"/>Act of Love may be produced in one Inſtant. And whereas that Act may be formed in the Soul without making any Traces in the Brain, we need not wonder if even thoſe who are come to Men's eſtate when they are Baptiz'd, do not always remember it; for we have no remembrance of thoſe things of which the Brain keeps no traces.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us that the Old Man or Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is Crucified with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that we are dead and buried with him by Baptiſm. It is not that we are then delivered from the warring of the Body againſt the Mind, and that Concupiſcence is, as it were, dead that moment? It is true it revives; but having been deſtroy'd, and thereby left the Children in a ſtate of loving God, it can no longer harm them, though it revives in them. For, when there are two Loves in the Heart, the one Natural and the other Free, Order wills that only that ſhould be regarded which is free. And if Children loved God in Baptiſm by an Act no wiſe free, loving Bodies afterwards by ſeveral Acts of the ſame kind; God perhaps could not according to Order, have more regard to one only Act, than to many, which are all natural and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. Or rather if thoſe contrary Loves were equal in force, he muſt have regard to the laſt; by the ſame reaſon, that when there have been ſucceſſively in a Heart two free Loves contrary to one another, God ever has regard to the laſt, ſince Grace is loſt by one Mortal Sin.</p>
                     <p n="20">XX. However it cannot be denied that God may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpending the Dominion of the Body over the Childs Mind, make it Juſt, or turn its Will towards him, by infuſing into its Soul a diſpoſition like unto that which remains after an Actual motion of Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. But that way of proceeding does not perhaps appear ſo natural as the other; for we do not conceive clearly what thoſe diſpoſitions may be which would remain. Indeed we need not wonder at it, for having no clear Idea of the Soul, as I have proved
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:107782:184"/>elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">See the 7th Chapter of the 2d Part of the ſaid Book, with its Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note>, we muſt not wonder if we do not know all the Modifications it is capable of. But the Mind cannot be fully ſatisfied with things it does not conceive clearly. In my Opinion it requires an extraordinary Miracle to give thoſe diſpoſitions to the Soul without a preceding Act. Surely it cannot be done by the moſt ſimple means. Whereas the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> producing for a moment in the Mind of the Child which is Baptis'd, the contrary of what the firſt did produce there before; it is ſufficient to regenerate it, that God ſhould act in it by the uſual means, according to which he ſanctifies the Adult; for the Child not having at that moment any ſenſations or motions to divide its capacity of <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>willing,</hi> nothing hinders it from knowing and loving its real Good. I ſay no more, becauſe it is not neceſſary to know preciſely, how the regeneration of Children is perform'd, provided we admit a real regeneration in them, or an inward and real Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cauſed by the Acts, or at leaſt by the habits of Faith, Hope, and Charity. If I propoſe an Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo contrary to received Prejudices; it is to ſatisfie even thoſe who will not admit ſpiritual habits, and to prove to them the poſſibility of Children's Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for <hi>Imputation</hi> ſeems to me to include a down right contradiction; ſince God cannot repute as juſt, and actually, love Creatures who are actually in diſorder; the he may for the love of his Son deſign to reſtore them to order, and love them when they are reſtor'd.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>All is then overthrown. There is no longer any Science, nor Morality, nor undeniable proofs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This Conſequence is clear to any one who apprehends this falſe Principle, that God produces Order and Truth by a Will abſolutely Free. But that is no Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>I Anſwer then, That God neither does nor wills any thing without knowledge; that therefore his Will ſuppoſes ſomething; but what is ſuppoſes is nothing
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:107782:185"/>that is Created. Order, Truth, Eternal Wiſdom, is the Pattern of all the Works of God, and this Wiſdom is not made. God who makes all things, never made it, though he conſtantly begets it by the neceſſity of his Being.</p>
                        <p>Whatever God Wills is in Order, from this only reaſon, that God Wills it: I own it. But it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God cannot Act againſt himſelf, againſt his Wiſdom and Light. He may forbear to produce any External thing; but if he will Act, he can only do it according to the Immutable Order of that Wiſdom which he neceſſarily loves; for Religion and Reaſon teach me, that he does nothing without his Son, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <hi>Word,</hi> without his Wiſdom. Therefore I am bold to ſay, that God cannot poſitively Will that the Mind ſhould be ſubject to the Body; becauſe this Wiſdom according to which God Wills whatever he Wills, ſhews me clearly that this is contrary to Order. And I ſee this clearly in that Wiſdom; becauſe that is the ſoveraign and univerſal Reaſon of which all Spirits do participate; for which all Intelligences are Created, by which all Men are Reaſonable. For no Man is his own Reaſon, Knowledge, and Wiſdom, unleſs it be perhaps when his Reaſon is particular, his Knowledge a falſe Light, and his Wiſdom Folly.</p>
                        <p>As moſt Men know not diſtinctly, that nothing but Eternal Wiſdom directs them, and that Intelligible Ideas, which are the immediate Object of their Mind, are not Created, they imagine that Eternal Laws, and Immutable Truths, have been eſtabliſh'd ſuch by a Free Will of God: And 'tis for that very reaſon <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> ſays, that God could have made two times four not to be eight, and that the three Angles of a Triangle ſhould not be equal two right ones,<note place="margin">An Anſwer to the 6th Objection againſt his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                           <hi>becauſe there is no Order,</hi> ſays he, <hi>no Law, no Reaſon of Goodneſs and Truth, but what depends on God,</hi> and that it is he, <hi>who from all Eternity has ordained and eſtabliſh'd.

                           </note> For God is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as to his External Works, but he is not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent though perfectly free, in the manner by which he does 'em; he always Acts in the Wiſeſt and moſt perfect manner poſſible; he always follows the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and neceſſary Order. Therefore God may chuſe whether he will create Spirits and Bodies; but if he creates thoſe two kinds of Beings, he muſt create them in the ſimpleſt way, and place them in a perfect order. He may for inſtance, unite Spirits to Bodies, but I affirm that he cannot ſubject them to 'em, unleſs in purſuance of the Order which he always follows, the Sin of Spirits obliges him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thus, as I have already explained in the 7th Article, and firſt Remark towards the latter end.</p>
                        <p>To prevent ſome Inſtances which might be objected againſt me, I think my ſelf obliged to ſay, that Men are in the wrong to Conſult themſelves, when they have a mind to know what God can do, or will. They ought not to judge of his Will by the Internal Senſations they have of their own Inclinations; for then they would often make an Injuſt, Cruel, and Sinful, inſtead of a powerful God. They ought to lay aſide the general Principle of their Prejudices, which makes them judge of all things according to themſelves: They muſt attribute nothing to God, but what they conceive clearly to be included in the Idea of an infinitely perfect Being; for they ought only to judge of things by clear Ideas. Then the God they will adore, will not be like unto thoſe of Antiquity, which were Cruel, Adulterous, Voluptuous, like the Perſons who had ſet them up. Nor will he ſo much as reſemble the God of ſome Chriſtians, who to make him as powerful as Sinners deſire him, aſcribe to him an abſolute power of Acting againſt all Order, of leaving Sin unpuniſhed, and Condemning ſome Perſons to Eternal Torments, though never ſo Juſt and ſo Innocent.</p>

                        <p>IF God Wills that Order which makes Monſters; I do not ſay among Men, for they have ſinn'd; but amongſt Animals and Plants; What is the Cauſe of the general Corruption of the Air which breeds ſo many Diſtempers? By what Order are Seaſons irregular, and the Sun of Froſts burn up and deſtroy the Fruits of the Earth? Does it argue Wiſdom or Order to give an Animal parts altogether uſeleſs, and to freeze Fruits after having form'd them? Is it not rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God does what he pleaſes, and that his Power is above all Order and Rule? For to ſpeak of things of greater Conſequence than ſome Fruits, with which it is lawful to do what he pleaſes; the Clay out of which God makes Veſſels of Wrath, is the ſame wherewith he makes Veſſels of Mercy.</p>

                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe difficulties are only fit to obſcure Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they proceed from the darkneſs of the Mind. We know that God is Juſt: We ſee that the Wicked Proſper; Muſt we deny what we ſee, muſt we doubt what we know; becauſe perhaps we may be ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid as not to know, or ſuch Libertines, as not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what Religion teaches us of future Puniſhments? So likewiſe, we know that God is Wiſe, and that he does nothing but what is Good; yet we ſee Monſters, or defective Works. What ſhall we believe? that God was miſtaken, or that thoſe Monſters are not from him. Certainly thoſe who have ſenſe or ſteadineſs of Mind, will believe neither; for it is evident that God does all, and that he does nothing but what is as perfect as poſſible, in reſpect to the ſimplicity and ſmall number of means which he imploys in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Works. We muſt keep ſteadily to what we ſee, without ſuffering our ſelves to be ſhaken by
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:107782:186"/>difficulties which it is impoſſible to reſolve, when our Ignorance is the cauſe of that impoſſibility. If Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be admitted to form Difficulties, and if ſuch Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties overthrow the beſt eſtabliſh'd Sentiments, what will be certain among Men who know not all things? What! ſhall not the moſt radiant Lights be able to diſſipate the leaſt Obſcurities; and ſhall any little Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be able to obſcure the moſt clear and lively Lights?</p>
                        <p>But though we might forbear anſwering ſuch like difficulties, without weakening the Principle we have eſtabliſh'd, yet it is fit the World ſhould know they are not altogether unanſwerable. For the mind of Man is ſo unjuſt in its Judgments, that it may perhaps prefer the Sentiments which ſeem to be Subjects of theſe imaginary Difficulties to real Truths, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be queſtioned, unleſs Men have a mind to do it on purpoſe, and therefore ceaſe to conſider them. I ſay then that God wills Order, though there are Monſters; and alſo, that there are Monſters, becauſe God loves Order. This is the Reaſon of it.</p>
                        <p>Order requires that the Laws of Nature, by which God produces that infinite Variety which we ſee in the World, ſhould be very plain, and very few. Now it is the Simplicity of thoſe general Laws, which in ſome particular caſes, and by reaſon of the diſpoſition of the Subject, produces irregular Motions, or rather mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Diſpoſitions: And conſequently there are Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, becauſe God wills Order. Thus God wills not poſitively or directly that there ſhould be Monſters; but he poſitively wills certain Laws of the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Motions, whereof Monſters are the neceſſary Conſequences: And he wills thoſe Laws, becauſe thô they are very plain, they are nevertheleſs capable of producing that variety of Forms, which we can never ſufficiently admire.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, in conſequence of the general Laws of the Communication of Motions, there are Bodies which are in ſome meaſure driven towards the Centre of the Earth. The Body of a Man, or of an Animal, is one of theſe: That which ſuſtains it in the Air ſinks under its Feet. Is it juſt and ſuitable to Order, That
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:107782:187"/>God ſhould change his general Will for that particular Caſe? Certainly that does not appear likely. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Animal muſt either break or maim his Body. We muſt argue in the ſame manner as to the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monſters.</p>
                        <p>Order indeed requires that all Beings ſhould have whatever is neceſſary for their Preſervation, and the Propagation of their Kind; provided it may be done by ſimple means, and ſuch as are ſuitable to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. And 'tis true we ſee that Animals, and even Plants, have general means for their Preſervation, and the continuation of their Kind; and if ſome Animals are deſtitute of them on certain particular occaſions, it is becauſe the general Laws according to which they have been form'd could not permit it, becauſe thoſe Laws do not relate to them alone, but generally to all Beings, and that publick Good muſt be preferred to private Advantages.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that if God made but one Animal, it would not be monſtrous. But Order would require that he ſhould not make that Animal by the ſame Laws by which he now forms all the reſt. For the Action of God muſt be proportion'd to his Deſign. By the Laws of Nature he makes not one Animal, but the whole World; and he muſt do it by the ſimpleſt means, as Order requires it. Therefore it is enough that this World is not monſtrous, or that the general Effects ſhould be worthy the general Laws, to hinder any one from finding fault with the Work of God.</p>
                        <p>Had God eſtabliſhed particular Laws for all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Alterations, or had he plac'd in every thing a particular Nature or Principle of the Motions which happen to it; I own it would be difficult to juſtifie his Wiſdom againſt ſo many viſible Irregularities. Perhaps we ſhould be oblig'd to own, either that God wills not Order, or that he cannot or will not remedy Diſorder. For in fine, it ſeems to me impoſſible to reconcile the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infinite number of Second Cauſes, or of Powers, Virtues, Qualities, and natural Faculties, with what we call the ſports or irregularities of Nature, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the Wiſdom and infinite Power of the Author of all things.</p>

                        <p>GOD can never act for himſelf. Thoſe that are wiſe do nothing that is uſeleſs; and whatever God ſhould do for himſelf, would be uſeleſs, for he wants nothing.

And if God deſires nothing, he does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for himſelf, ſince he only acts by the Efficacy of his Will. The Nature of God is to communicate and be diffuſive; to be uſeful to others, and not to it ſelf; to ſeek; and if poſſible, to create Perſons whom it may render happy. Therefore God being Eſſentially and Sovereignly Good, it implies a Contradiction that he ſhould act for himſelf.</p>

                        <p>GOD may act <hi>for himſelf</hi> two ways, either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive ſome advantage by what he does, or that his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may find its happineſs and perfection in him.

I only aſſert, That God can neither make nor preſerve Spirits, in order to their knowing and loving the Creatures: It is an unalterable, eternal, and neceſſary Law, that they ſhould know and love God, as I have explain'd in the Third Article. Therefore this Objection does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn my Principle; but on the contraey it favours it: And if it be certain that it is the Nature of God to Communicate and extend it ſelf, (for I do not examine this Axiome) it is evident that God being Eſſentially and Sovereignly Good, it implies a Contradiction that he ſhould not act for himſelf in the ſenſe which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to eſtabliſh.</p>

                        <p>AS Ignorance is a Conſequence of Sin, <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall, had a perfect Knowledge of the Nature of his own Body; and of all thoſe which wer about him. For inſtance, it was neceſſary he ſhould perfectly know the Nature of all Animals, to give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Names to them, as he did.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a miſtake. Ignorance is neither an Evil, nor a Conſequence of Sin: It is error or blindneſs of the mind which is an Evil, and a Conſequence of Sin. There is none but God who knows every thing, and is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of nothing: Ignorance dwells in the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Intelligences. Whatever is finite cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend infinity. And therefore there is no Mind that can ſo much as apprehend all the Properties of Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. <hi>Adam,</hi> in the moment of his Creation, knew whatever was fit for him to know, and nothing more; and it was not fit he ſhould have known exactly the diſpoſition of all the parts of the Body, and of thoſe he made uſe of: I have given Reaſons for it in this Article, and elſewhere.</p>
                        <p>A giving of Names is rather a ſign of Authority in the Scripture, than of a perfect Knowledge. As the Lord of Heaven had made <hi>Adam</hi> Lord of the Earth, he was willing <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould give the Animals Names, as he himſelf had done to the Stars.<note place="margin">Omnibus eis nomina vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat.

                           </note> It is evident that Sounds or Words neither have, nor naturally can have a Relation to the things they ſignifie, whatever the Divine <hi>Plato</hi> and myſterious <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſay about it. One might perhaps explain the Nature of a Horſe, or of an Ox, in a whole Book; but a Word is not a Book: And it is ridiculous to imagine that Monoſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, as <hi>Sus,</hi> which in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies a Horſe, and <hi>Schor,</hi> which ſignifies an Ox, ſhould repreſent the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:107782:188"/>of thoſe Animals. Nevertheleſs, it is very likely that thoſe are the Names which <hi>Adam</hi> has given them; for we find them in the Book of <hi>Geneſis:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Cap.</hi> 49.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32.5.</note> And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Geneſis</hi> aſſures us moreover, That the Names which <hi>Adam</hi> gave to the Animals, are the very ſame which were uſed in his time; for I do not ſee that he could mean any thing elſe by theſe words, <hi>Omne quod vocavit</hi> Adam <hi>animae viventis, ipſum eſt nomen ejus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I grant that <hi>Adam</hi> gave Names to Animals which had ſome Relation to their Nature, and ſubmit to the learned Etymologies which an Author of this Age gives us about them. I grant that <hi>Adam</hi> might call Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Animals <hi>Behemoth,</hi> becauſe they keep ſilence; the Ram <hi>Ajil,</hi> becauſe he is ſtrong; the Goat <hi>Sair,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is hairy; the Hog <hi>Chazir,</hi> becauſe he has lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eyes? and the Aſs <hi>Chamor,</hi> becauſe there are many red ones in the Eaſt. But I think it enough only to open ones eyes to know whether the Goat is hairy, the Aſs red, and whether the Hog has little eyes, <hi>Adam</hi> calls <hi>Beir</hi> and <hi>Behemah</hi> what we call a Brute, or a great Domeſtick Animal, becauſe thoſe Beaſts are mute and ſtupid: What is to be concluded from thence, that he perfectly underſtood their Nature? That is not evident. I ſhould rather fear that Men would conclude from thence, That <hi>Adam</hi> being ſimple enough to interrogate an Ox, as the largeſt of all Domeſtick Animals, and being ſurpris'd at his not being able to anſwer him, he deſpis'd him, and in contempt called him by the name of <hi>Beir,</hi> and of <hi>Behemah.</hi>

                        <p>I own that there are Pre-engaging Senſations which are diſagreeable and painful: But they were never uneaſy to the firſt Man; becauſe that, as ſoon as ever they began to aſſault, he would no longer be affected by them; and as ſoon as ever he had that he was no longer affected by them. Thoſe Senſations only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively gave him notice of what he was to do, or not to do: They did not diſturb his Felicity; they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made him ſenſible that God could puniſh him and make him miſerable, if he ſhould prove unfaithful to him.</p>
                        <p>To perſuade our ſelves that the firſt Man was never ſurpris'd by any ſenſible Grief, we need only conſider two things: Firſt, that Grief is very inconſiderable, when the Motions to which it is annext are very weak; ſince it is always proportion'd to the ſtrength of the Motions which are communicated to the principal part of the Brain. Secondly, that it is the nature of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion always to include a ſucceſſion of time, and that it cannot be violent at the firſt inſtant it is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. This being ſuppos'd, it is plain that the firſt Man was never ſurpris'd by any violent Grief, that was capable of making him unhappy: For it was in his power to ſtop the Motions which occaſion'd it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it was in his power to ſtop them at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant they began their Action, certainly he did not fail to do it, ſince he deſir'd to be happy, and that Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is naturally joyn'd with the ſenſe of Pain.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Adam</hi> never felt any violent Pain: But I think we are not oblig'd to ſay that he never felt any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable uneaſineſs, like unto that which we feel when we taſte green Fruit, which we thought to be ripe. His Felicity would have been very tender, if it could have been diſturb'd by ſo ſmall a matter : For Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy is a ſign of Weakneſs; and Pleaſure and Joy have but little Solidity in them, when the leaſt thing diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates and annihilates them.

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:107782:189"/>Happineſs effectually, unleſs it is involuntary, and when it ſubſiſts in us againſt our Wills. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was happy, even upon the Croſs, though he felt great Pains, becauſe he ſuffer'd nothing but what he was willing to ſuffer. Therefore as <hi>Adam</hi> ſuffer'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt his Will, no body can ſay that we make him unhappy before his Fall, becauſe we ſuppoſe here, that he was warned by pre-engaging Senſations; but ſuch as were reſpectful and ſubmiſſive of what it was fit for him to avoid for the preſervation of his Life.</p>

                           <note place="margin">See the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation upon the <hi>3d</hi> Chapter of the <hi>5</hi> Book,</note>I anſwer in the ſecond place, That it is not true that the Pleaſure of the Soul is the ſame thing with its Motion and Love. Pleaſure and Love are manners of the Soul's Exiſtence: But Pleaſure has no neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Object which ſeems to occaſion it; and Love has a neceſſary Relation to Good. Pleaſure is to the Soul what Figure is to the Body; and Motion is
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:107782:190"/>to the Body what Love is to the Soul. Now the Motion of a Body is very different from its Figure. I grant that the Soul, which is continually mov'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Good, advances as it were more eaſily towards it, when induc'd thereto by Pleaſure, than when it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Pain; as a Body which is puſh'd forward, rouls more eaſily when it has a Spherical Figure, than when it has a Cubical one. But the Figure of a Body is different from its Motion, and it may be Spherical, and ſtand ſtill. It is true, Spirits are not like Bodies; they can feel no Pleaſure, without being in Motion; becauſe God, who only makes and preſerves them for himſelf, moves them continually towards Good. But this does not prove that the Pleaſure of the Soul is the ſame thing with its Motion; for two things, though different, may always meet together.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I anſwer, That though Pleaſure were not different from the Love or Motion of the Soul, that which the firſt Man felt in the uſe of the Goods of the Body, did not incline him to love thoſe Bodies. Pleaſure inclines the Soul towards the Object which occaſions it: I grant it. But it is not the Fruit which we eat with Pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which occaſions that Pleaſure in us. Bodies cannot act in the Soul, and make it in any meaſure happy: God only can do that. 'Tis through Error we fancy that Bodies have that in them which we feel by their means. Adam was not ſo ſtupid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Fall, as to imagine that Bodies occaſion'd his Pleaſure. Therefore the Motion which accompanied his Pleaſures, did not move him towards Bodies. If Pleaſure contributed towards the Fall of the firſt Man, it was not by cauſing that in him which it now cauſes in us. It is only the taking up or dividing the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city he had to think, it blotted or diminiſhed in his Mind the Preſence of his real Good, or of his Duty.</p>

                        <p>WHat likelihood is there that the immutable Will of God ſhould have depended on the Will of Man; and that in favour of <hi>Adam</hi> Exceptions ſhould have been made in the general Law of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Motions.</p>

                        <p>At leaſt it is not evident, that there can be no ſuch Exceptions. But it is plain that immutable Order requires that the Body ſhould be ſubject to the Mind; and it were contradictory to believe that God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loves nor wills Order:<note place="margin">In the Explanation which relates to the Nature of Ideas, I ſhall explain more particularly what Order is, and why God loves it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily.</note> For God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, loves his Son. Therefore it was was, neceſſary, before the fall of the firſt Man, that Exceptions ſhould be made in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in the general Law of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Motions. This perhaps may ſeem abſtruſe; but here is ſomething that is more ſenſible.</p>
                        <p>Man, though a Sinner, has the Power to move and ſtop his Arm whenever he pleaſes. Therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different Volitions of Man, the Animal Spirits are determin'd to produce or ſtop ſome Motions in his Body; which certainly cannot be done by the general Law of the Communication of Motions. Thus the Will of God being ſtill at this very time ſubject to ours, why might it not have been ſubject to <hi>Adam</hi>'s? If, for the advantage of the Body, and for the ſake of Civil Society, God ſtops the Communication of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Sinners, why ſhould he not have ſtopt it in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a Juſt Man, for the Good of his Soul, and for the Preſervation of the Union and Society he had with him; for God had only made Man for himſelf? As God will have no Society with Sinners, he has taken from them, after the Fall, the power they had to leave as it were the Body, to unite themſelves to him. But
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:107782:191"/>he has left them the Power to ſtop or change the Communication of Motions in reference to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Life, and Civil Society; becauſe he was unwilling to deſtroy his own Work, having even before he had form'd it, deſigned, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to reſtore it, and reform it in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                        <p>MAN ſtill conveys his Body at this time where he will; he moves as he pleaſes all the parts of it, the motion of which is neceſſary for the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and avoiding of ſenſible Good and Evils. And conſequently he ſtops or changes every moment the Natural Communication of Motions, not only in things of ſmall Conſequence; but alſo in things which are of no uſe for Life or Civil Society, and even in Crimes which ruine Society, ſhorten Life, and diſhonour God in all reſpects. God Wills Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I grant it. But does Order require that the Laws of Motion ſhould be violated for Evil, and remain inviolable on the account of Good? Why ſhould not Man have the Power to ſtop the Motions which ſenſible Objects produce in his Body, ſince thoſe Motions hinder him from doing good, from drawing near to God again, and from returning to his Duty; and ſtill have the Power to do ſo much evil, with his Tongue, his Arm, and with the other parts of the Body, the Motions of which depend upon his Will?</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>To anſwer this Objection, we muſt conſider, that Man having ſinn'd was to return to his Original No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs. For being no longer in order, nor in a poſſibility to return to it, he ought to ceaſe to exiſt. God loves nothing but Order;<note place="margin">See the 5th Dialogue of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note> a Sinner is not in Order: Therefore God does not love him. Sinners then cannot ſubſiſt, ſince Creatures only ſubſiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God will have them to <hi>be,</hi> and God will not have them to <hi>be</hi> unleſs he loves them. Neither can a Sinner reſtore himſelf to Order, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtifie himſelf, and whatever he can ſuffer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attone for his Offence: Therefore he ought to be reduced to nothing again.</p>
                        <p>But whereas it is unreaſonable to think, that God ſhould make a Work to annihilate it, or to put it yet into a worſe condition; it is evident that God would not have made Man, nor permitted his fall which he had foreſeen, had he not had in view his Sons Incarnation; in whom all things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and by whom the Univerſe receives a Beauty, Perfection, and Greatneſs worthy the Wiſdom and Power of its Author.</p>
                        <p>We may then conſider that Man after his Sin is without a Reſtorer, but under expectation of one. If we conſider him without a Reſtorer, we ſee clearly that he can have no Society with God; that he cannot have the leaſt power in himſelf to draw near unto God again; that God muſt needs repulſe and uſe him ill when he pretends to leave the Body to unite himſelf to him: That is to ſay, that Man after Sin muſt loſe the power of freeing himſelf from ſenſible Impreſſions and Motions of Concupiſcence. Moreover he ought to be annihilated for the reaſons aboveſaid. But he expects a Reſtorer; and if we conſider him under that expectation, it is plain he muſt ſubſiſt, together with his Poſterity out of which
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:107782:192"/>the ſaid Reſtorer is to come; and therefore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Man after his fall ſhould ſtill retain the power of moving diverſly all thoſe parts of his Body whoſe motions may be uſeful towards his preſervation.</p>
                        <p>It is true Men continually abuſe that Power they have of producing certain Motions; and that that Power, for inſtance, they have to move their Tongue ſeveral ways, occaſions an infinite number of Evils. But then it is evident, that this Power is abſolutely neceſſary to maintain Society; to eaſe one another in the wants of this preſent Life; and to be Inſtructed in that Religion, which gives the hopes of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for whoſe ſake the World ſubſiſts. If we carefully examine thoſe Motions which we produce in our ſelves, and in what part of our Body we can produce them, we ſhall find clearly that God has left us no more Power over our Body, than what is neceſſary to preſerve our Life, and maintain Civil Society. For inſtance, the Beating of the Heart, the Dilatation of the Diaphragme, the Periſtaltick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bowels, the Circulation of the Spirits and Blood, and divers Motions of the Nerves in our Paſſions, are produced in us without ſtaying for Orders from the Soul. As they muſt needs be partly the ſame on the ſame Occaſions, nothing obliges God to ſubmit them now to the Will of Men; But whereas the Motions of the Muſcles which ſerve to ſtir the Tongue, the Arms and Legs, muſt change every moment, according to the almoſt infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the Good or Ill Objects which ſurround us; it was neceſſary thoſe Motions ſhould depend on the Will of Men.</p>
                        <p>We muſt obſerve, that God always Acts by the moſt ſimple Means, and that the Laws of Nature muſt be general; and therefore having given us the Power to move our Arm and Tongue, he muſt not take away that Power from us to ſtrike a Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, or to Calumniate him. For if our Natural Faculties did depend on our Deſigns, there would be no Uniformity, nor certain Rule in the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:107782:192"/>which nevertheleſs muſt be very plain and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to be ſuitable to the Wiſdom of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Order. Inſomuch that God, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Decrees, chooſes rather to perform the <hi>Materiality</hi> of Sin, as the Divines ſay, or to ſerve the Injuſtice of Men, as one of his Prophets ſays, than by changing his Will to put a ſtop to the diſorder of Sinners: But he reſerves his Vengeance for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy treatment he meets with, until he may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to do it without acting againſt the Immutability of his Degrees; that is, when Death having corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Body of the Voluptuous, God will lye no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger under the neceſſity he has impos'd upon himſelf of giving them Senſations and Thoughts relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

                        <p>ORiginal Sin does not only make Man a Slave to his Body, and ſubject to the motions of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, but likewiſe fills him with Spiritual Vices: The Childs Body is not only corrupted before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but its very Soul and all its Faculties are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Sin. Though the Rebellion of the Body is the chief cauſe of ſome groſs Vices, as Intemperance and Incontinency; yet it does not occaſion Vices that are purely Spiritual, ſuch as Pride and Envy. So that Original Sin is ſomething very different from the Concupiſcence wherewith we are Born: and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the privation of Grace, or of Original Juſtice.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I own that Children are depriv'd of Original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: and I prove it when I ſhow they are not born Juſt, and that God hates them. For in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it is impoſſible to give a clearer Idea of Juſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> and of Righteouſneſs, than in ſaying; that the Will is upright, when it loves God, and that it is irregular when it is turn'd towards the Body. But if by Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Juſtice or Grace, you mean certain or unknown Qualifications, like unto thoſe which 'tis ſaid God had infus'd into the Soul of the firſt Man, to adorn it, and to render it agreeable in his ſight; it is alſo evident, that the privation of this Juſtice is not Original Sin; for properly ſpeaking that Privation cannot be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If Children have nor thoſe Qualifications, it is becauſe God does not give 'em to them. And if God does not give 'em, it is becauſe they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it. 'Tis then that unworthineſs which is tranſmitted, and which is the cauſe of the privation of Original Juſtice. Therefore 'tis that unworthineſs which properly ſpeaking is Original Sin.</p>
                        <p>Now this unworthineſs, which conſiſts, as I have ſhown in this, that the Inclinations of Children are actually corrupted, that their Heart is turn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Bodies and Loves them; this, I ſay, is really in them: It is not the Imputation of their Fathers Sin, they are actually in diſorder. So thoſe that are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of which <hi>Adam</hi> was the Figure, are not juſtify'd by Imputation: They are actually reſtor'd into Order by an inward Juſtice, different from that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> tho' it is only he that has me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited it for them.</p>
                        <p>The Soul has but two Natural or Eſſential Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the one to God, the other to its Body. Now it is evident, that the Relation or Union it has with God, can neither corrupt it, or make it vicious. Therefore it is only ſo in the moment of its Creation, by the Relation it has to its Body. So that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:107782:193"/>to ſay, either that Pride, and the other Vices, which are call'd Spiritual, may be Communicated by the Body, or that Children are not liable to them at the moment of their Birth. I ſay at the moment of their Birth, for I do not deny but thoſe ill habits are eaſily acquir'd. Yet pure Intelligences have no other relation then to God, and that in the moment of their Creation they were ſubject to no Vice, yet they are fallen into Diſorder; but 'tis only by their having made an ill uſe of their Liberty; and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have made no uſe of it, for Original Sin is not free.</p>
                        <p>But I am of Opinion, that thoſe are miſtaken who fancy the Rebellion of the Body only occaſions groſs Vices, as Intemperance and Incontinency; and not thoſe which are call'd Spiritual, as Pride and Envy. And I am perſwaded, that there is ſuch a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the diſpoſitions of our Brain and thoſe of our Soul, that perhaps the Soul has no ill habit but what derives its Principle from the Body.</p>
                        <p>Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in divers places, calls Law, Wiſdom, Deſires, and the Works of the Fleſh, whatever is contrary to the Law of the Spirit; he does not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Spiritual Vices. He places among the Works of the Fleſh, Idolatry, Hereſies, Diſſentions, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Vices, which are call'd Spiritual. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Doctrine we follow the motions of the Fleſh, in being guilty of Vain-glory,<note place="margin">Gal. c. 5.</note> Paſſion and Envy. Finally, it appears by the Expreſſions of that Apoſtle, that all Sins proceed from the Fleſh; not that the Fleſh commits them, or that the Spirit of Man, without Grace or the Spirit of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> does that which is good, but becauſe the Fleſh acts upon the Mind of Man, in ſuch a manner, that it does no Evil which the Fleſh does not ſollicit.<note place="margin">Rom. c. 7.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks thus about it in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, I delight in the Law of God after the inward Man. But I ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law in my Members warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in the Members of my Body.</hi> And afterwards, <hi>So then with the Mind, I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:107782:194"/>but with the Fleſh the Law of Sin.</hi> He ſpeaks after the ſame manner in ſeveral other places of his Epiſtles; ſo that Concupiſcence, or the Rebellion of the Body, does not only incline us to thoſe Vices which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or unſeemly, but even to thoſe that are thought to be Spiritual. I will endeavour to prove it after a ſenſible manner.</p>
                        <p>When any Perſon is in company, to my ſeeming, it is certain that Traces are machinally form'd in his Brains, and Motions are excited in his Animal Spirits, which beget Wicked thoughts and inclinations in his Soul. Our thoughts, at thoſe times, are not naturally conformable to Truth, nor our inclinations to Order: They ariſe in us for the good of the Body, and of the preſent Life, becauſe they are excited by the Body; therefore they make us loſe the preſence of God, and the thoughts of our Duty, and only tend to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men reſpect us as being worthy of their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Eſteem. So that this ſecret Pride, which is ſtirr'd up on thoſe occaſions. is a Spiritual Vice, of which the Rebellion of the Body is the Principle.</p>
                        <p>For Inſtance, If the Perſons before whom we are are Honourable, the Pomp of their Grandeur dazles and humbles us. As the Traces which their preſence excites in our Brains, are ſometimes very great, and their Motions very lively, they ſhine, as it were, throughout our Body; they diffuſe through our Face, and ſenſibly diſcover Reſpect and Fear there, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our moſt conceal'd Sentiments. In the next place, theſe Traces, by theſe ſenſible Expreſſions of our inward Motions, affect the Perſon who looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; they inſpire him with Sentiments of Mildneſs and Civility by the Traces, which our reſpectful or timerous Air produce machinally in his Brains, which reflecting on his Face, conceal that Majeſty which appear'd there before, and give the reſt of his Body a Poſture which compoſes our Trouble, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſures us. So that after many repercuſſions of thoſe ſenſible Expreſſions, our Air and Deportment are ſettled at laſt in the ſtate which this Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deſires.</p>
                        <pb n="433" facs="tcp:107782:194"/>
                        <p>Now as all the Motions of the Animal Spirits are attended by the Motion of the Soul, and as the Traces of the Brain are followed by the Thoughts of the Mind; it is evident, that being now deprived of the Power to obliterate thoſe Traces, and to ſtop thoſe Motions, we find our ſelves ſollicited by the preſence of the Perſon who is above us, to enter into his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and deſires, and to apply our ſelves wholly to him, as he is inclined to make his application to us, though after a different manner. And this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Converſation of the World revives and ſtrengthens the deſire of Pride, as diſhoneſt Commerce, Feaſting, and the injoyment of Senſual Pleaſures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Carnal Deſires; the Moral of which deſerves our obſervation.</p>
                        <p>'Tis very neceſſary there ſhould be Traces in the Brain to repreſent a Man continually to himſelf, that he may take care of his Perſon; and that there ſhould be others to form and maintain Society, ſince Men were not made to live alone. But Man having loſt the Power to obliterate thoſe Traces at pleaſure, and when it might be convenient, they ſollicit him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to evil. As he cannot help repreſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to himſelf, he is continually excited to motions of Pride and Vanity, to deſpiſe others, and to attribute all things to himſelf; and whereas he is not maſter of the Traces which ſollicit him, to maintain Society with others, he is agitated as it were againſt his Will, by motions of Complaiſance, Flattery, Jealouſie, and the like Inclinations. Thus all the Vices which are called Spiritual, proceed from the Fleſh, as well as Incontinency and Intemperance.</p>
                        <p>There are not only diſpoſitions in our Brain which excite Senſation and Motions in us, in relation to the Propagation of the Species and the Preſervation of Life; there are perhaps yet a greater number of them which ſtir up Thoughts and Paſſions in us, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Society, to our particular advancements, and thoſe of our Friends. We are Naturally united to all the Bodies which ſurround us, and by thoſe Bodies to all things that have any relation to us. Now we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:107782:195"/>be united to them but by certain Diſpoſitions which are in our Brain. Therefore, not having the Power to hinder the Action of thoſe Natural Diſpoſitions, our Union is changed into a Dependance, and we become ſubject to all manner or Vices through our Body.</p>
                        <p>We are not pure Intelligence: All the Diſpoſitions of our Soul produce ſome Diſpoſitions in our Body; as the Diſpoſitions of our Body excite the like Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in our Soul. It is not that the Soul cannot abſolutely receive any thing but by the Body: But becauſe ſo long as it is united to it, it can receive no alteration in its Modifications, without the Body's alſo receiving ſome. It is true that it may be Inlightned, or receive new Ideas, without the neceſſity of the Body's having any ſhare in them: But it is becauſe pure Ideas are no Modifications of the Soul, as I have prov'd it elſewhere. I do not ſpeak of ſenſible Ideas here; for thoſe Ideas include a Senſation, and all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are Manners of the Souls Exiſtence.</p>

                           <hi>and that it is through her we are all liable to Death:</hi> Neither of them ſpake of the Man, St. <hi>Paul</hi> on the contrary ſays, that it is by Man Sin was introduced into the World: He ſpeaks not of the Woman.</p>
                        <p>How muſt we reconcile thoſe Teſtimonies, and which of the Two ought we to Juſtifie, if it were neceſſary to Juſtifie either?<note place="margin">A muliere initium factum eſt peccati, &amp; per illam omnes mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. <hi>Ecch 25.23. Luc. 2.48.</hi>
                           </note> In Diſcourſe we never attribute any thing to the Woman in which ſhe has no ſhare, and which is only the Man's: But we often attribute that to the Man which is proper to the Woman, becauſe the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is her Head and Maſter. We ſee that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, and even the Bleſſed Virgin calls <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Father of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt; when ſhe ſays unto her Son: Thy Father and I have ſought thee ſorrowing; <hi>Ecce pater tuus &amp; Ego dolentes quaerebamus.</hi> Therefore ſince the Holy Scripture aſſures us that it is by the Woman we are all liable to Death and to Sin, it is abſolutely neceſſary to believe it: Nor can it be thrown upon Man. But though it aſſure us in other places that by Man Sin came into the World, there is not the ſame neceſſity to believe it, ſince that may be attributed to the Man which belongs to the Woman. And if we were obliged by Faith to excuſe either the Man or the Woman, it would be mote reaſonable to excuſe the Man than the Woman.</p>
                        <p>However I am of opinion that the Paſſages I have quoted ought to be explained in the Literal ſenſe, and that we ought to conclude, That both the Man and the Woman are the Real Cauſes of Sin, each in their way. The Woman, becauſe Sin is Communicated by her, as it is by her that Man begets Children: And
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:107782:196"/>Man, becauſe his Sin has occaſion'd Concupiſcence, as his Action is the Cauſe of the Impregnation of the Woman, or of the Communication which is between the Woman and her Child.</p>
                        <p>'Tis certain that it is the Man who impregnates the Woman, and conſequently he is the Cauſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication which is between her Body and the Childs, ſince that Communication is the Principle of its Life. The ſaid Communication does not only give to the Bodies of Children the Diſpoſitions of their Mothers; it alſo gives to their Minds, the Diſpoſitions of her Mind. Therefore we may ſay, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> That <hi>By Man Sin was introduced into the World;</hi> and nevertheleſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of that Communication, we may alſo ſay, that <hi>Sin proceeds from the Woman;</hi> that it is <hi>by her we are all lyable to Death, and that our Mother has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us in Iniquity,</hi> as it is ſaid in other places of the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it may be urged, That though Man had not ſinned, the Woman would have had ſinful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for having ſinned her ſelf, ſhe had loſt the Power God had, given her over her Body: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Man had remained Juſt, ſhe would have Corrupted the Brain, and conſequently the Mind of her Child, upon the account of the Communication ſhe had with it.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, this does not appear lively: For Man whilſt Righteous, knowing what he does, cannot give the Woman that miſerable Fruitfulneſs of conceiving ſinful Children. If he remains Righteous, he will have no Children but for God, and ſinful Children can never be acceptable to God; for I do not ſuppoſe a Mediator in this place. However I grant, that in this caſe the Marriage might not have been diſſolved, and that the Man might have known his Wife. But it is certain, the Body of the Woman did belong to her Husband, ſince it was taken out of his, and was of the ſame Fleſh; <hi>Duo in carne una.</hi> It is alſo certain, that the Children belong as much to the Father as to the Mother. This being granted, we can never imagine that the Woman, after her Sin, would have loſt the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:107782:196"/>power ſhe had over her Body, unleſs her Husband had ſinned as well as her ſelf; for had the Woman been deprived of that power, her Husband remaining in Innocence, there would have been this diſorder in the Univerſe, That a Juſt Man ſhould have had a Corrupt Body and Sinful Children. Now, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Order, or rather it is contradictory, that a Juſt God ſhould puniſh the Man, when he is in perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. Therefore <hi>Eve</hi> feels no Involuntary and Rebel Motions immediately after her Sin: She is not as yet aſhamed to ſee her ſelf naked: She does not hide her ſelf: On the contrary, ſhe draws near to her Husband, though naked as well as her ſelf: Her Eyes are not as yet opened: She is, as before, the abſolute Miſtreſs of her Body. Order required that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after her ſin her Soul ſhould have been diſturbed by the Rebellion of her Body, and by the ſhame of her own and Husband's Nakedneſs: For it was not reaſonable that God ſhould any longer ſuſpend the Laws of the Communication of Motions in favour of her, as I have ſaid in the Seventh Article. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as her Body belongs to her Husband, and her Husband is ſtill Innocent; ſhe is not puniſhed in that Body: That puniſhment is deferred until he has himſelf eaten of the Fruit which ſhe preſented to him. Then it was they both felt the Rebellion of their Bodies; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they were naked; and that ſhame obliged them to cover themſelves with Fig-Leaves. Therefore we muſt ſay, That <hi>Adam</hi> is really the Cauſe of Original Sin and Concupiſcence, ſince it is his ſin that has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived his Wife as well as himſelf of the power they had over their Bodies, and that it is for want of this power the Woman produces Traces in her Brain, and in the Brain of her Child, which corrupt the Soul from the very moment it is created.</p>

                        <p>Thoſe ſpeak by gueſs who ſay, that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Mothers Brain with that of her Child, is neceſſary or uſeful towards the Conformation of the Foetus: For there is no ſuch Communication between the Brain of a Hen and her Chickens; and yet the Chickens are perfectly well form'd.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>ANSWER.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I Anſwer, that in the Seventh Chapter of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book I have ſufficiently demonſtrated that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, by the uſe I make of it to Explain the Generation of Monſters, and certain Marks, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Apprehenſions. For it is evident, that a Man who falls into a ſwoon at the ſight of a ſnake, becauſe his Mother was frightned by one while ſhe bore him, can only have this Weakneſs, becauſe the Traces were formerly form'd in his Brain like unto thoſe which open themſelves when he ſees a ſnake, and that the ſaid Traces have been attended with the like accident. Therefore I gueſs not; for I do not preſume to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine wherein the ſaid Communication does preciſely conſiſt. I might ſay, it proceeds from the Fibres which the Foetus ſhoots into the Mothers Womb, and by the Nerves with which that part is probably fill'd. And yet I ſhould no more gueſs in this than a Man, who never having ſeen the Machines of the * <hi>Samaritan,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Fountain upon</hi> Pont Neuf <hi>in</hi> Paris.</note> ſhould affirm that there are Wheels and Pumps in it to draw up the Water. However, I am of opinion it is ſometimes lawful to gueſs, provided we do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſet up for Prophets, or ſpeak with too much aſſurance. I fancy, Men may be allowed to ſay what they think, provided they do not aim at Infalibility, or injuſtly impoſe upon Mens Minds with a diſciſive
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:107782:197"/>behaviour, or by the help of ſome Terms of Art. We do not alwayes gueſs in ſaying things that are not ſeen, and are contrary to Prejudices, provided we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay what may be conceived well, and enter eaſily into the Minds of thoſe who are willing to hearken to Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I ſay, that in ſuppoſing the general Laws of the Communication of Motions, ſuch as they are, it is very likely that the particular Communication of the Mothers Brain, with the Childs is neceſſary, in order to form its Body as it ought to be; or at leaſt, that it is neceſſary to make the Childs Brain receive certain Diſpoſitions, which muſt vary according to Times and Countries; as I have explained in the ſame Chapter.</p>
                        <p>I own that there is no Communication between the Brain of a Hen and that of a Chicken, which is formed in an Egg, and that nevertheleſs the Body of the Chicken is perfectly formed. But you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Chicken is far more forward in the Egg when the Hen ſits upon it, than the <hi>Foetus</hi> when it deſcends into the Womb. We may eaſily judge this; ſince it requires leſs time to hatch the Eggs, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, than to have Puppies; notwithſtanding the Belly of a Bitch being very hot, and her Blood in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion, the Whelps ought to be ſooner formed than the Eggs hatched, if the Chickens were not more forward in their Eggs, than the Puppies in their Germ. Now it is very likely, that the ſaid forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chicken in the Egg before its being laid, was produced by the Communication I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
                        <p>I Anſwer in the ſecond place, That the growth of the Body of Fowls is perhaps more conformable to the general Laws of Motion, than that of four-footed Beaſts; and therefore the Communication of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males Brain with her Young, is not ſo neceſſary in Birds as in other Animals. For the Reaſon which makes the ſaid Communication neceſſary, is probably to remedy the defect of the General Laws, which are
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107782:198"/>not ſufficient in ſome particular caſes for the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Increaſe of Animals.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I Anſwer, That it is not neceſſary for the Preſervation of the Life of Birds, that there ſhould be as many particular Diſpoſitions in their Brain, as in that of other Animals: They have Wings to avoid harm, and to catch their Prey: They have no need of all theſe particular ſprings, which are the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Cunning and Docility of ſome Domeſtick Animals. Therefore it is not neceſſary that the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male in forming them ſhould inſtruct them with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, or make them capable of being inſtructed of them by a Diſpoſition of Brain proper for ſuch Docility. Thoſe who train up young Dogs for Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do ſometimes meet with ſome who ſett Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the bare Inſtruction they have received from the Bitch, who has often Hunted whilſt big with Whelps. A difference is generally obſerved among the breed of Animals, and that ſome are apter and more capable to be inſtructed than others of the ſame kind. But I don't believe, that ever any Bird taught her Young ones any thing extraordinary; or that a Hen, for inſtance, ever hatched a Chicken, that could do any thing beſides what they Naturally do: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Birds are not ſo apt, nor ſo capable of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as other Animals. The Diſpoſition of their Brain is not commonly capable of much variation: They do not act ſo much by Imitation, as ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Animals do. Young Ducks, that are hatch'd of a Hen, do not tarry for her Example, to leap into the Water; neither do Chickens uſe themſelves to ſwim, though hatched by a Duck, which leads them, and ſwims continually. But there are Animals which eaſily and quickly imitate the extraordinary Motions which others perform before them. Nevertheleſs, I do not pretend, that Men ſhould rely much on theſe laſt Reflections; ſince they are not neceſſary to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh what I bring them for.</p>

                           <hi>Second Objection.</hi> Againſt the Twelfth Article.</head>
                        <p>'Tis alſo nothing but Gueſs, to affirm, That the Mother before her Sin might have any intercourſe with her Embrio; for there is no neceſſary relation between our Thoughts and the Motions that paſs in our Brain. Therefore this Communication of the Mothers Brain to the Childs, is uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>ANSWER.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is evident, that without the ſaid Communication, the Child could not have any Commerce with its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor the Mother with it. Now before the Fall, Order required that the Mother ſhould be acquainted with all the Corporal wants of her Child, and that the Child ſhould not be ignorant of its Obligations to its Parents. Therefore as all things were in Order before the Fall, and that God alwayes acts according to Order, the Mother and Child would have had ſome Commerce by means of the ſaid Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>To apprehend wherein this ſaid Commerce might have conſiſted: We muſt remember that the relation of the Traces of the Brain, with the Ideas of the Soul, may be made ſeveral wayes; either by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or the Will of Men, or ſome other way, as I have explained in the Second Book<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>2.</hi> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part</note>.</p>
                        <p>When we look upon a Square, or upon the Air of a perſon who indures pain, we have in our minds the Idea of a Square, or of ſome perſon in affliction: This is common to all Nations, and the relation which is between theſe Ideas and Traces is natural. When an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> hears any one pronounce this word, <hi>Square,</hi> he alſo has the Idea of a Square: But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that is between the ſound, or the characters of
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:107782:199"/>this word and his Idea, is not natural; neither is it common to all Men. Therefore I ſay, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Child would naturally have had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between them about all things that can be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Mind by natural relations. And if (for inſtance) the Mother had ſeen a Square, the Child would alſo have ſeen it; and had the Child imagined any Figure, it would alſo have excited the Trace of the ſaid Figure in its Mothers imagination. But the Mother and the Child would not naturally have had a commerce together about things that are purely ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, nor yet about ſuch as are corporeal, if they had conceived them without making uſe of their ſenſes or imagination. The Mother would have thought on God, ſhe would have heard people read this word <hi>Square,</hi> or the like, without the Child's having been able to diſcover what thought ſhe had: Unleſs ſhe could have been able in time to have eſtabliſhed a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Intellectual Ideas with it, almoſt as Nurſes do when they teach their Children how to ſpeak. But to explain and prove theſe things.</p>
                        <p>I think I have ſufficiently ſhowed, by the Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have given of the cauſe of Hereditary Averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the marks we draw from our Birth, that the Traces of Mothers are communicated to their Children. The Traces of corporal things are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from their Ideas: Therefore thoſe Ideas alſo communicate themſelves, and Children feel and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the ſame things with their Mothers. Now it is againſt their will they feel what their Mothers feel: But were they not Sinners, they would have the power to hinder at pleaſure the effect of the communication they have with their Mothers. Moreover, they would be adle to excite in their Brain the Traces they had received, from the ſame reaſon as we imagine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we pleaſe, when our Senſations are not too lively. This being ſuppoſed, it is evident that the Mother, being attentive to her Child, might diſcover by a kind of repercuſſion, whether or no it would receive the impreſſion ſhe ſhould excite in it, and alſo the other things ſhe ſhould think on. For as the Mother would
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:107782:199"/>not be able to move the Fibres of her Brain, without making an impreſſion thereby on the Childs; neither could the Child receive the ſaid impreſſion, without the Mothers having notice of it by ſome ſlight impreſſion, provided ſhe became very attentive to it by the power ſhe ſhould have to make all other noiſe ceaſe but that which her Child ſhould excite in her. Therefore we muſt conclude, that the Child and irs Mother would have had ſome commerce together before the Fall, or deny the relation of the Brain of the one to the Brain of the other, or the power of the Soul over the Body, as I have before eſtabliſhed. This appears evident, though the imagination is ſtartled at it and prejudice oppoſes it. 'Tis true, that at firſt that commerce would only have been in ſuch things as are lyable to our ſenſes and imagination. Children being only related to their Mothers by their Bodies, it is not abſolutely neceſſary they ſhould receive any Ideas from them but thoſe of ſenſible Objects. For their Soul, being ſtrictly united to God, if we conſider them without ſin, they receive immediately from him all the Ideas which have no relation to the Body. But whereas it is poſſible, in time to find the moſt abſtracted Ideas to ſenſible things which have no relation to them, the commerce of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with their Children would probably have ſoon extended it ſelf to the moſt ſpiritual things, had they endeavoured to entertain themſelves upon thoſe matters.</p>
                        <p>I am extreamly ſenſible that what I ſay here will not appear very reaſonable to the generality of men, and that even thoſe who impugn Prejudices and the continual Effort of ſenſible Impreſſions, will be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the novelty of this Thought. But if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſeriouſly upon the manner how a Maſter inſtructſ his Diſciple, if we conſider how many different means he is obliged to make uſe of to diſcover to him the Ideas he himſelf has of things, the compariſons he makes of them, the judgments he gives about them, and the other diſpoſitions, of his mind in relation to them; we ſhall find, that Mothers have a far greater facility to diſcover their thoughts, and inward diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:107782:200"/>to their Children, than Maſters to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; provided we only ſuppoſe that the Traces of the Mothers Brain are imprinted on that of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Which is evident by what I have ſaid. For in fine, it is plain that voice and all external ſigns we uſe, to expreſs our thoughts to others, have only the effect we deſire, becauſe they imprint on the Brain of thoſe who hearken to us, the ſame Traces, and excite the ſame Emotions of the Spirits, which accompany our Ideas, and inward diſpoſition in relation to them.</p>

                           <hi>OBJECTION:</hi> Againſt the Seventeenth Article, and the following ones.</head>
                        <p>It is preſumptuous to ſay, that Children are Juſtified in Baptiſm by Actual motions of their Will towards God. We ought not to give way to new Opinions, that only ſerve to make a Noiſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>ANSWER.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I grant, we muſt not ſay poſitively that Children are Juſtified by formal Acts of their Will. I believe no man knows any thing about it, and we muſt affirm nothing poſitively but what we know. But whereas there are but too many of thoſe who believe the Juſtification of Children is only external and by imputation, becauſe (ſay they) they are incapable of forming any Act of Love towards God: I believe it neceſſary to make them ſenſible that their Opinion only proceeds from Prejudice. For the Prejudices of Men in relation to Children are ſuch, that they commonly imagine they do not think in their Mothers Womb and in their firſt Years, and moreover that they are incapable of thinking. Men fancy they have not as yet the Ideas of things in themſelves; that they are
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:107782:200"/>inſpired into them by their Maſters in Diſcourſe; and that if they have any inclinations, they are not of the ſame nature with ours, and that they cannot lead them to ſoveraign Good. The generality of men do not apprehend diſtinctly that the Soul of children is like that of perſons advanced in years; that is does not fortify and perfect it ſelt like the Body; and that if it were delivered for one moment from the impreſſion which the Body makes upon it, and moved by the Delectation of Grace, it would be more inlightened and more pure in that moment, than that of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saints who always fight againſt ſome concupiſcence in their mind and heart.</p>
                        <p>Concupiſcence is commonly look'd upon as if it were natural: Men do not always think that it is a conſequence of ſin. Therefore they judge unawares that the Stupidity of children is a neceſſary conſequence of the Weakneſs of their Body, of their Youth, and even of the incapacity of their Mind. Now this Judgment or Prejudice repreſents it ſelf continually to the mind, and pre-ingages it in ſuch a manner as to hinder it from examining the thing in it ſelf. So thoſe who have ſpoken of Baptiſm in former Ages, have not explained the Regeneration of children by Actual motions of their Heart. Not becauſe ſtrong Reaſons induced them to judge that it was impoſſible; for it does not appear by their Works that they have ſo much as examined it: But rather becauſe they have ſuppoſed it ſo, and have hardly had any thoughts to doubt it, or perhaps becauſe they were unwilling to give an Explication which would have oppoſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, at a time when people were not ſo ſolicitous to lay them aſide, as they are at preſent.</p>
                        <p>But if we conſider the neceſſity there is of giving a more exact Explanation, for Inſtance, than St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> does in ſome paſſages, which favours<note n="*" place="margin">B. <hi>1.</hi> de Nupt.

                  <p>AS I am convinced that the moſt general, and moſt exuberant Principle of the Errors we meet with in Sciences, and particularly in Morality, is the Impreſſion which lively Imaginations make upon Mens Minds, who are guided more by Mechaniſm than by Reaſon; I thought my ſelf obliged to make the World ſo ſenſible of this Truth, as to awaken Men out of their Lethargy, in relation to it. And whereas Examples are moſt powerful over us, eſpecially when there is ſomething great and extraordinary in them, I have thought that the celebrated Names of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Seneca,</hi> and of <hi>Montagne,</hi> would be capable of exciting their Attention, and convince them ſenſibly of the contagious power of the Imagination over Reaſon. For in fine, if dead Words, which are not animated by the Air and ſenſible Behaviour of thoſe
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:107782:202"/>famous Authors, have ſtill more force than the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of certain Perſons: If the turn of Expreſſion, which gives but a weak Idea of the ſenſible Action, which the Imagination diffuſes livelily upon the Face, and the reſt of their Body, who are perſwaded of what they ſay, is capable of agitating, penetrating, and convincing many; certainly it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that nothing can be more dangerous than a reſpectful attention to Perſons, whoſe Imagination is ſtrong and lively. For their Air and manner of ſpeaking, is a Natural Language, ſo ſtrong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing; they know how to draw things ſo much to the Life, that they commonly make the Paſſions and the Senſes riſe againſt Reaſon; that they infuſe, as it were, conviction and certainty into all thoſe who look upon them.</p>
                  <p>I was very ſenſible, that in producing theſe great Examples, I ſhould not cure all thoſe who had been ſtruck with aſtoniſhment and admiration at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe three famous Authors. For there is no need to very well acquainted with the Nature of Man, to know that the Wounds which the Brain has received, are harder to be cured than thoſe of the other parts of the Body; and that it is eaſier to cloſe a Wound which is not expoſed to the Action of ſome Body that may renew it, than perfectly to cure cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prejudices which are juſtified every moment by very probable Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>It is very difficult to cloſe up the Traces of the Brain exactly, becauſe they are expoſed to the courſe of the Spirits, and may be continually renewed by a vaſt number of Traces, which may be called acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Thoſe kind of Wounds cannot commonly be cured or cloſed up, unleſs it be when the Brain hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received others that are deeper and oppoſite to them, a ſtrong and continual revulſion is made in the Spirits. For we muſt not imagine that a Prejudice is abſolutely cured as ſoon as we fancy it is; becauſe we are not actually affected with it. A Prejudice is only abſolutely cured, when the Trace is perfectly cloſed up; and not ſo ſoon as the Spirits begin no
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:107782:202"/>longer to take their courſe that way for ſome particular Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I was very ſenſible that thoſe who had been overcome by the Force and Motions of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſay'd and dazzled by the Greatneſs and Beauties of <hi>Seneca,</hi> charm'd and corrupted by the free and natural Expreſſions of <hi>Montaigne,</hi> would not change their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents after the reading of a few <hi>Pages</hi> of my <hi>Book.</hi> I judg'd on the contrary, that they would be diſpleaſed at my Endeavours to diſſipate the Spell which charms them.</p>
                  <p>But whereas I was in hopes that theſe Examples would prove of uſe to my Deſign, for the Reaſons I have alledged; I thought my ſelf obliged to have more regard to the Advantage many perſons may derive by it, who are unprejudiced, than to the Uneaſineſs of ſome others, whom I thought would criticize upon the Liberty I have taken. I conſidered alſo, that there are few Men ſo much prejudiced in favour of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as to deſpair of prevailing with them, to ſide with Reaſon again. Laſtly, I thought that as there are perhaps no Men prejudiced in favour of all three of them, by reaſon of the diverſity of the Character of their Imaginations, the moſt obſtinate might think that I am in the right in many things.</p>
                  <p>I know the reſpect I owe to the Works of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as well upon the account of the Subjects he treat of, as the approbation they have had from ſeveral perſons who ought to be Judges of them. And I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcovered this diſpoſition of my Mind, by what I have ſaid concerning them, and by the quality of the Book <hi>de Pallio,</hi> the only one I have freely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, though there are others which perhaps would have been fitter for my Deſign.</p>
                  <p>But after all, I do not think that Time ought either to magnifie or alter the Ideas of things, that all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are Venerable, and that falſe Reaſons and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Expreſſions deſerve Reſpect, becauſe they have been introduced into the World long before us. I do not think we are obliged to receive Affected Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities like Sacred Myſteries; Sallies of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:107782:203"/>like evident Truths; The Hearts of <hi>Africk</hi> which Labour in a Mind naturally full of Fire, like the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Prophetical Spirit, which can only teach Sublime Truths.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible that even thoſe who have moſt reſpect for <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Works, allow all this, and that they are too Equitable to Juſtifie the irregularities of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination againſt Reaſon. But perhaps they are like thoſe Judicious Perſons who are great Lovers of Truth, and yet are taken with the Stile. For I have often met with ſome of them who were ſo much inchanted by ſome ſtrong, lively, great and magnificent Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Tertullian;</hi> that after having proved to them, that the Author was neither Judicious, not very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, they did nothing but repeat them to me to ſurprize and perſwade me.</p>
                  <p>I own that <hi>Tertullian</hi> has very bold and ſtrong Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and that they produce very Lively and Sprightly Images in the Mind: And 'tis for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I take him for an Example, that ſtrong Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have much power to act, and convince by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Therefore thoſe who make thoſe kind of Objections to me, confirm my Opinion, while they oppoſe it. The Prepoſſeſſion or Eſteem they have for <hi>Tertullian,</hi> juſtifies my Conduct. The frequent Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and the Pompous Words they alledge from him, prove what I ſay. For men ſeldom quote in Diſcourſe intire Arguments: But they often quote ſtrong and lively Expreſſions, to dazzle and to convince by ſenſible Impreſſion.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe no body will imagine that I pretend to cenſure ſo many Great Men who daily quote <hi>Tertullian</hi> in their Pulpits. They have Reaſons for it, which I do not pretend to Examine. What I have ſaid of that Author to me ſeems evident. Let every Man make his Inferences according to his own knowledge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imputing Thoughts to me which I never had. Thoſe who pretend to dive into the Deſigns of others, often form Phantaſms which are only like themſelves: For it is uſual for us, to diffuſe, as it were, the Malignity of our Paſſions upon others. We
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:107782:203"/>judge of all Things by our ſelves: And thoſe who do condemn me, perhaps judge themſelves; though they reflect not upon it. But if the World would have me to declare my Opinion about <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Quotations, I own that Men are in the right to make uſe of them for ſeveral Reaſons; and alſo that they are ſometimes very uſeful to make ſome Practical Truths the more ſenſible, which are barren and unfruitful, ſo long as they are in the ſecret Receſſes of our Reaſon, and excite in us no Motions contrary to thoſe which the goods of the Body do.</p>
                  <p>However I do not think there is any thing unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in their Opinion who maintain, That we ought never to quote Authors by Name, but when they are infallible; and that unleſs it be in ſuch things in which Reaſon has no ſhare, or in which Authority muſt take place, we ſhould never quote any Body. This was formerly the Cuſtom of the Fathers. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> never quoted <hi>Tertullian,</hi> though he has taken many things from him. And if we may credit what St. <hi>Jerome</hi> relates of that Holy Biſhop, by report, that ſpeaking of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> he called him his Maſter; certainly the Name of <hi>Tertullian</hi> had no great Authority, nor his Expreſſions the power they have at preſent over Mens Minds: or elſe St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> followed the Cuſtom of his Time with a very ſurprizing Rigor. For it is very ſtrange that ſuch a Diſciple ſhould never have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his Maſter in any of his Works.</p>
                  <p>This Story of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> is commonly made uſe of to defend <hi>Tertullian;</hi> And I have been told ſometimes, that I was to blame to ſpeak as I did of no Man whom St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> called his Maſter. But I do know not whether St. <hi>Jerome</hi> was not too credulous in believing a thing which made for the honour of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> He ſeems to have had a little too much inclination for him, ſince he has in ſome meaſure excuſed his Fall, by imputing his Hereſie to the Envy of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy, and to the ill Treatments he had received from them. But, if this Story be true which is only
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:107782:204"/>grounded upon what St. <hi>Jerome</hi> has heard one Perſon ſay,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Invidiâ poſtea, &amp; contumeliis Clericorum</hi> Romanae <hi>Eccleſiae, ad</hi> Montani <hi>dogma de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſus, in multis libris novae prophetiae memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit.</hi> Hieron. <hi>in Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo de Script. Eccl.</hi>
                     </note> I own that I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the meaning of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Silence in his Writings in relation to <hi>Tertullian.</hi> This Silence of the Diſciple ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal ſome Myſtery which is not to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Maſter. And if Hiſtory as well as <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s own Works, did not ſufficiently diſcover, that he is not altogether wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the great Eſteem many Men have for him. I queſtion whether St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Behaviour, his Silence, his Stile, and his Expreſſions, would not be ſufficient to leſſen it, and perſwade us that this ſaid Authors Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation was not very great even in <hi>Africk</hi> it ſelf, which ought to have been more favourable to him than ſo Temperate a Country as ours is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> produce very different Minds. The Genius of the <hi>French</hi> being Natural, Reaſonable, and an Enemy to all forc'd Expreſſions, I wonder how there are Perſons among them who are paſſionately affected with an Author, that neither ſtudied nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Nature; and who, inſtead of conſulting Reaſon, ſuffers himſelf often to be ſo much ſway'd by his Paſſion, as to uſe Expreſſions that are altogether Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, Monſtrous, and Extravagant.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps it is becauſe Imagination has ſo much Force that it weakens Reaſon, and even changes Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Indeed a Paſſionate Man diſturbs us, and for the moſt part changes the natural Order of our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to conform it to his. And then all Motions ſeem natural, all manner of Expreſſions are agreeable, all ſort of Bombaſt convinces; for Men examine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeriouſly. And whereas the Paſſions juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and depraved Imaginations delight only in their irregularities, we can never judge ſoundly of things, as long as the Brain preſerves the violent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion it has received. All Paſſionate Men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſollicited to juſtifie the Paſſion which Animates them: There is no Diſtracted Man, but is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his Diſtraction. For if thoſe who fancy themſelves to be Cocks, Wolves, Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:107782:204"/>extreamly delighted with the Actions of thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, though they are abſolutely contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Men; it may very well be concluded that we are far from condemning the behaviour of thoſe, who by the contagion of their Imagination, have in ſome meaſure, made us like themſelves; for in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them, we feel that we condemn our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>There is a very particular Reaſon, which makes ſome Learned Men proud of appearing <hi>Tertullians</hi> Proſelytes, and obliges them to expreſs a particular reſpect for that Author; It is the obſcurity which he affects, as one of the principal Rules of Rhetorick.</p>
                  <p>Now adays all Expreſſions that are ſenſleſs, and all obſcure and perplex'd wayes of ſpeaking, go under the name of non-ſenſe; but there have been Men who looked upon obſcurity as one of the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Eloquence; among them the Art of Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did in ſome meaſure conſiſt in making themſelves unintelligible.</p>
                  <p>Had thoſe who ſpeak in publick, alwayes clear and diſtinct Ideas of the Truths they pretend to perſwade; and did they only ſpeak to Perſons capable of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient attention to apprehend them, the Precept of affecting obſcurity in Diſcourſe, would be extravagant in all reſpects. But though this Precept is abſolutely contrary to Reaſon, we may ſay, it is pretty well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the Genius of moſt Men; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cloaks the Ignorance of thoſe who ſpeak; but alſo becauſe miſterious obſcurity excites in many, ſuch Sentiments as diſpoſe them to ſubmit, and to ſuffer themſelves to be convinced.</p>
                  <p>Experience ſufficiently ſhows, that moſt Men eſteem what they do not apprehend; that they revere as Myſteries whatever ſurpaſſes them; and that they admire an Orator, who dazzles them with lofty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and with a Language of Imagination, in which Reaſon has no ſhare.</p>
                  <p>The Inclination Men have for Greatneſs, is ſtronger than that they have for Truth. Therefore Pompous Nonſenſe, which perſwades by Imagination, is better received than pure Reaſonings, which can only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:107782:205"/>by Evidence. Evidence prevails only by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which alwayes coſts ſome Trouble; but ſenſible Conviction pours it ſelf into the Soul, and penetrates it after a pleaſing manner.</p>
                  <p>The good which alone is capable to ſatisfie us, is at once infinite and inacceſſible, and great and obſcure Expreſſions bear the character of it: So that obſcurity exciting our Deſires, as greatneſs excites our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſteem; thoſe Expreſſions prevail upon us by the Motions they produce in us.</p>
                  <p>When Men underſtand, or think they underſtand, a difficult obſcure Author, they think better of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than of thoſe who do not underſtand him; they look upon them as ignorant Perſons. The pains they have been at to underſtand him, ingages them in his defence. They juſtifie their ſtudy in revering him, and making others do the ſame. And as Men delight in juſtifying themſelves; they never fail to praiſe and to defend ſuch an Author zealouſly, and after a very lively and ſenſible manner.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reaſons, and ſome ethers that are leſs ſtrong, are ſufficient, in my Opinion, to ſhow that <hi>Tertullians</hi> Obſcurity is no wiſe diſadvantageous to him in the minds of ſome Perſons; and that probably they would never have admired him ſo much; had the Truths which are diſperſed through his Works, been reduced to their plaineſt and moſt clear Ideas.</p>
                  <p>We alwayes reduce Mathematical Relations and Truths to their <hi>Exponents;</hi> I mean, to the plaineſt Terms that can expreſs them; and we diſingage them from whatever might perplex or obſcure them: For Geometricians love plain Truth; they do not deſire to convince by Impreſſion, but by Evidence and Light. What would become of many of <hi>Tertullians</hi> Thoughts, ſhould any one reduce them to their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents,</hi> according to the Rules of Geometricians and Logicians, and alſo ſtrip them of that ſenſible ſhow which dazzles Reaſon? We ought to try that Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if we deſign to judge ſolidly of that Authors Arguments.</p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:107782:205"/>
                  <p>However I do not pretend that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ought to have written like a Geometrician. Figures which expreſs our Sentiments and Motions, in relation to Truths which we expoſe to others, are abſolutely neceſſary. And I am of Opinion, that particularly in Diſcourſes of Religion and Morality, we ought to make uſe of ſuch Ornaments as are proper to make Men pay that reſpect to Truth which is due to it, and of ſuch Motions as are fit to move the Soul, and incline it to Vertuous Actions. But we ought never to adorn Phantaſms which are without ſubſtance or reality We muſt never excite uſeleſs Motions; and if we would forcibly imprint conviction and certainty on the Minds of thoſe who hearken to us, that Conviction muſt have a relation to ſomething that is true and ſolid. We muſt never convince, nor ſuffer our ſelves to be convinced, without knowing evidently, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and preciſely, of what it is we convince People, or what it is we are convinced of. We muſt know what we ſay, and what we believe. And we muſt love Truth and Knowledge, and not blind others, after having ſuffered our ſelves to be blinded.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>I Was in hopes, that what I have ſaid about the Nature of Ideas, would be enough to make Men apprehend, that it is God who inlightens us: But I find by Experience that there are many Perſons who are incapable of ſufficient attention to conceive the Reaſons I have given of that Principle. Whatever is abſtracted, is incomprehenſible to moſt Men; nothing affects them but that which is ſenſible, and fixes and maintains the light of their Mind. They cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and conſequently cannot apprehend that which falls not under the apprehenſion of their Senſes nor Imagination. This is what I have often ſaid, and what I can never reſpect too much.</p>
                     <p>It is evident, that Bodies are not viſible of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that they cannot act over our Mind, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent themſelves to it: This wants no Proof: But is infinitely more certain, than that Bodies communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Motions to each other, when they meet. But this is only certain to thoſe who ſilence their
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:107782:206"/>Senſes to hearken to their Reaſon. All Men fancy that Bodies puſh one another, becauſe the Senſes tell them ſo: But they do not believe that Bodies are of themſelves abſolutely inviſible, and incapable to act on the Mind, becauſe the Senſes do not ſay it, but ſeem to intimate the contrary.</p>
                     <p>There are nevertheleſs ſome Perſons, whoſe ſolid and ſteady Reaſon elevates it ſelf to the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Truths: They contemplate them with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſiſt the impreſſion of their Senſes, and Imagination with great Courage. But by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the Body ſtupifying the Mind, they relapſe: Thoſe Ideas are diſſipated, and their Imagination ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing others that are more lively and more ſenſible; thoſe firſt are no longer like any thing but Spectors which Men miſtruſt, and of which they dread the illuſion.</p>
                     <p>We eaſily doubt Perſons or things that are not familiar to us, or that have not afforded us ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Pleaſures: For 'tis Pleaſure that wins the Heart, and Familiarity removes Trouble and diſquiet from the Mind. Therefore thoſe who are not uſed to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical and Abſtracted Truths, are very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, that thoſe have a mind to ſeduce them, who only ſtudy to inform them. They look with a kind of diffidence and horrour on ſuch Ideas as have nothing that is agreeable or ſenſible in them; and the love they have for Quiet and Felicity, ſoon delivers them from a ſight which diſturbs them, and which ſeems incapable of contenting them.</p>
                     <p>Were not the preſent queſtion of the utmoſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the Reaſons aboveſaid, and ſome others which are not neceſſary to be related, would oblige me to ſpeak no further of it: For I foreſee, that whatever I may ſay upon that ſubject, will never enter into the mind of certain Perſons. But this Principle, that there is none but God who inlightens us, and that by the manifeſtation of an immutable and neceſſary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Wiſdom, appears to me ſo conformable to Religion, that I think my ſelf indiſpenſibly obliged to explain, and maintain it as much as I can. I had
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:107782:207"/>rather be called a Viſionary, a Lunatick, and bear all the Ridicule that the Imagination (which in little Souls is alwayes ſarcaſtical) oppoſes to ſuch Reaſons it does not apprehend, or cannot defend it ſelf againſt; than to grant that Bodies are capable of inlightning me; that I am my own Maſter, Reaſon, and Light; and that to get a ſolid knowledge of all things, I need only conſult my ſelf; or Men, who perhaps may make a great deal of Noiſe at my Ears, but who certainly cannot inlighten my Mind. Therefore I yet here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſome Reaſons, to maintain the Sentiment I have eſtabliſhed in the Chapters to which this belongs.</p>
                     <p>Every one agrees, that all Men are capable of knowing Truth; and the Philoſophers, nay even the leaſt among them, own that Man participates of a certain Reaſon which they do not determine: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they define him, <hi>Animal RATIONIS par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeps;</hi> for every one knows at leaſt confuſedly, that the Eſſential difference of Man conſiſts in the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary union he has with the Univerſal Reaſon, though it is not commonly known who it is that includes that Reaſon, which Men take but little care to diſcover. I ſee, for inſtance, that two and two make four;<note place="margin">Si ambo videmus verum eſſe quod dicis, &amp; ambo videmns ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſſe quod dico, ubi quaeſo id videmus?

Now I ſee not theſe Truths in the mind of others, neither do they ſee them in mine. Therefore there muſt needs be an Univerſal Reaſon which informs me, and all Intelligent Beings. For if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which I conſult were not the ſame which anſwers the <hi>Chineſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conf. of St. <hi>Aug.

So that the Reaſon we conſult when we look within our ſelves, is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Reaſon; I ſay, when we look within our ſelves; for I ſpeak not in this place of the Reaſon which is
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:107782:207"/>followed by a Paſſionate Man. When a Man prefers his Horſes Life before his Coachmans, he has ſome Reaſons for it; but they are particular Reaſons which a Rational Man abominates. They are Reaſons which at the bottom are not Reaſonable, becauſe they are not conſonant to the ſoveraign, or univerſal Reaſon which all Men conſult.</p>
                     <p>I am certain that the Ideas of things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and that Eternal Truths and Laws are neceſſary: It is impoſſible they ſhould be otherwiſe than they are. But I ſee nothing in my ſelf that is immutable or neceſſary: I might not be, or not be what I am. There may be Spirits who are not like me, and yet I am certain there can be no Spirits who ſee other Truths, and other Laws, than I do: For all Spirits ſee of neceſſity that two and two are four, and that we ought to prefer our Friend before our Dog. Therefore we muſt conclude, that the Reaſon which all Spirits conſult, is an immutable and neceſſary Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is evident, that this ſame Reaſon is infinite. The Mind of Man conceives clearly that there are, or may be an infinite number of intelligible Triangles, Tetragones, Pentagones, and other the like Figures. He does not only conceive that he ſhall never want the Ideas of Figures, and that he ſhall alwayes diſcover new ones, though he ſhould only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to thoſe ſort of Ideas to all Eternity; but he alſo obſerves infinity in Extenſion. The Mind ſees clearly that the Number which multiplyed by it ſelf, produces 5, or any of the Numbers between 4 and and 9, between 9 and 16, between 16 and 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a Quantity, a Relation, a Fraction, whoſe Terms contain more Figures than can reach between the two Poles of the World. He ſees clearly that it is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which none but God can apprehend, and that it is impoſſible to expreſs it exactly, becauſe to expreſs it, requires a Fraction whoſe two terms muſt be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. I might give many Examples of this Nature, from whence it may be concluded, not only that the Mind of Man is bounded; but alſo the Reaſon which
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:107782:208"/>he conſults is infinite. For the Mind clearly perceives infinity in this Reaſon, though it does not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it; ſince it can compare incommenſurable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with one another, and know their Relations, though it cannot compare them with unity. Or, to ſtop only at that which is moſt ſenſible, the Reaſon which Man conſults, is infinite, ſince it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and it has alwayes ſomething to anſwer to whatever we demand.</p>
                     <p>But if it be true, that the Reaſon whereof all Men participate, is univerſal; if it be true that it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; that it is immutable and neceſſary: It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it is not different from that of God himſelf: For nothing but the Univerſal and Infinite Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it ſelf an Univerſal and Infinite Reaſon. All Creatures are particular Beings; therefore Univerſal Reaſon is not Created. No Creatures are Infinite; therefore Infinite Reaſon is not a Creature. But the Reaſon which we conſult, is not only univerſal and infinite, but alſo neceſſary and independant, and in one ſenſe we conceive it to be more independant than God himſelf. For God can only act according to that Reaſon: He has a dependance on it in one ſenſe: He muſt guide it and follow it. God conſults none but himſelf; He has no dependance on any thing. Therefore that Reaſon is not diſtinguiſhed from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: It is Coeternal and Conſubſtantial with him. We ſee clearly that he cannot puniſh an innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; that he cannot ſubject Spirits to Bodies; that he is obliged to follow Order. Therefore we ſee the Rule, the Order, the Reaſon of God: For what Wiſdom could we ſee beſides the Wiſdom of God, when we preſume to ſay, that God is obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it?</p>
                     <p>But after all, can we conceive a Wiſdom that is not the Wiſdom of God? Does <hi>Solomon,</hi> who ſpeaks ſo well of Wiſdom, diſtinguiſh it into two kinds? Does he not teach us, that the Wiſdom which is Coeternal with God himſelf, and by which he has eſtabliſhed the Order that we fee in his Works, is the very ſame which preſides over all Spirits, and which Legiſlators
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:107782:208"/>conſult, to make Juſt and Reaſonable Laws. The Eighth Chapter of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this Truth. I am ſenſible the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of a certain Wiſdom, which it calls the Wiſdom of the Age, Wiſdom of Men. But it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſpeaks of things according to appearances, or according to the common opinion: For it teaches us elſewhere, that that Wiſdom is but Folly and Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not only before God, but before all Men who conſult Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, did Eternal Truths and Laws depend on God, had they been eſtabliſhed by the Creators Free Will; in a word, were not the Reaſon which we conſult neceſſary and independent: It appears evident to me, that there would be no true Science, and that we might very well be miſtaken in affirming, that the Arithmetick or Geometry of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> is like ours. For in fine, if it were not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that 2 times 4 ſhould make 8; or that the three Angles of a Triangle ſhould be equal to two right ones; what Proofs could we have that thoſe kind of Truths were not like thoſe which are received in ſome Univerſities, or that only laſt a certain time? Can we ſee clearly that God may not ceaſe to Will what he has Will'd once with a Will abſolutely free and indifferent? Or rather, do we ſee clearly that God might not have Will'd certain things for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, for a certain place, for certain perſons, or for certain kinds of Beings; ſuppoſing, as the World will have it, that he was abſolutely free and indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in that Will? For my part I can conceive no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in indifference, nor reconcile two things that are ſo oppoſite.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs I am willing to ſuppoſe that Men ſee clearly, that God by an abſolutely indifferent Will has eſtabliſhed Eternal Truths and Laws for all times and places; and that they are now immutable by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. But where do they ſee this Decree? Has God Created any repreſentative Being of that Decree? Will they ſay that this Decree is a Modification of their Souls? They ſee this Decree clearly; for they
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:107782:209"/>have learnt by it, that immutability is annexed to Eternal Truth and Laws: But where do they ſee it? Certainly unleſs they ſee it in God, they ſee it not at all: For that Decree can only be in God; and it is only to be ſeen where it is. Therefore Philoſophers can be certain, of nothing, unleſs they conſult God, and unleſs God anſwers them. Let them exclaim ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much at this, they muſt ſubmit to it, or be ſilent.</p>
                     <p>But after all this Decree is an imagination without any foundation. When we think on Order, on Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Truths and Laws, we inquire not Naturally into their Cauſe; for indeed they have none. We ſee not the neceſſity of that Decree clearly, we never think immediately on it. On the contrary, we perceive at firſt ſight, and that with evidence, that the Nature of Numbers, and of intelligible Ideas is immutable, neceſſary and independent. We ſee clearly that it is abſolutely neceſſary that 2 times 4 ſhould be 8, and that the Square of the Diagonal of a Square ſhould be the double to that Square. If any queſtion the abſolute neceſſity of theſe Truths, it is becauſe they turn their eyes from them; becauſe they reaſon upon a falſe Principle; and look elſewhere, and not into theſe Truths, to find their Nature, their Immutability and Independence. Therefore the Decree of the Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of thoſe Truths is a Fiction of the Mind, which ſuppoſing it ſees not what it really perceives in the Wiſdom of God, yet knowing that God is the cauſe of all things, thinks it ſelf obliged to fancy a Decree to aſſert an immutability to Truths, which it cannot forbear to acknowledge immutable. But 'tis a falſe ſuppoſition which we ought to beware of. Eternal, immutable and neceſſary Truths are only ſeen in the Wiſdom of God. We can ſee no where but in that Wiſdom, the Order which God himſelf is obliged to follow as aforeſaid. The Mind is only made for that Wiſdom, and in one ſenſe it can ſee nothing elſe. For if it can ſee Creatures, it is becauſe he whom it ſees, though after a very imperfect manner in this Life, comprehends them all in the Immenſity of his Being,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:107782:209"/>after an intelligible manner proportionate, as I have ſaid elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Had we not the Idea of Infinity in our ſelves, and did not wee ſee all things by the Natural Union of our Mind with the Univerſal and Infinite Reaſon, it ſeems evident to me that we ſhould not have the Liberty to think on all things. For the Mind can never have any deſire to apply it ſelf to any thing, but ſuch as it has ſome Idea of; and it can never think actually on any thing, but ſuch to which it can have a deſire to apply it ſelf. Thus we deprive Man of the Liberty of thinking on all things, in ſeparating his Mind from him who includes all things. Moreover, as we can Love only what we ſee, if God gave us only particular Ideas, it is evident he ſhould determine all the Motions of our Will after ſuch a manner as that we would be neceſſitated only to Love particular Beings. For if we had no Notion of Infinity we could not Love it, and if thoſe who affirm poſitively that they have no Idea of God, ſpoke as they thought, I ſhould not ſcruple to ſay, they have never Loved God; for it appears very certain to me, that we cannot Love what we do not See.</p>
                     <p>In fine, if Order and the Eternal Laws were not immutable by the neceſſity of their Nature; the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt proofs of Religion, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, would be deſtroyed in their Principle, as well as Liberty and the moſt certain Sciences. For it is moſt evident, that the Chriſtian Religion, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to us as a Mediator and Redeemer, ſuppoſes the Corruption of Nature by Original Sin. Now, what proof can we have of that Corruption? The Fleſh wars againſt the Mind, ſome may ſay, It ſubdues and enſlaves it. I grant it. But a Libertine will ſay, this is no Diſorder. It is God's pleaſure; he has ordained it ſo; he is Maſter of his Decrees; he puts what Order he pleaſes among his Creatures. How ſhall we prove to him that the Mind's being ſubjected to the Body is a Diſorder, unleſs we have a clear Idea of Order, and Neceſſity: And unleſs we know that God himſelf is obliged to follow it by the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:107782:210"/>neceſſary Love he has for himſelf? Beſides, if the ſaid Order depends on a free Decree of God, we ſhall ſtill be obliged to have recourſe to God to be informed of it: We ſhall be obliged to conſult God notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the averſion which ſome of the Learned have to have recourſe to him: We ſhall be obliged to ſubmit to this Truth, That we ſtand in need of God's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to be inſtructed. But this free Decree, which has cauſed Order, is a Fiction of the Mind, for the Reaſons I have already alledged.</p>
                     <p>If it were nor a neceſſary Order that Man ſhould be made for his Author, and that our Will ſhould be ſubject to the Order which is the Eſſential and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Rule of the Will of God: If it be not true that Actions are good or ill, according as they are conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or contrary to an immutable and neceſſary Order, and that this Order requires that the firſt ſhould be rewarded and the other puniſht: In fine, unleſs Men have naturally a clear Idea of Order, nay of ſuch an Order as God himſelf cannot will the contrary of that which this Order preſcribes, certainly I ſee no longer any thing but Confuſion among us. For, what fault can be found with the moſt infamous and unjuſt Actions of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> to whom God hath given no Laws? What Reaſon will dare to Judge them, if there is no Supream Reaſon to Condemn them?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Nec natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra poteſt juſto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernere iniquam. <hi>Lucre. Diog.</hi>
                        </note>A Poet hath ſaid, It is impoſſible to diſcern what is juſt from what is unjuſt. A Philoſopher has ſaid, that it is a Weakneſs to be concern'd at, or aſhamed of infamous Actions. Men often ſpeak thoſe kind of Paradoxes out of a fury of Imagination, and in the heat of their Paſſions. But why ſhould thoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be condemned unleſs there be an Order, a Rule, a General Reaſon, which always preſents it ſelf to thoſe who know how to look within themſelves? We freely Judge our ſelves and others, on many Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But by what Authority do we do it, if the Reaſon which Judges within us, when we think we pronounce Judgments againſt our ſelves and againſt others, be not Supream, and common to all Men?</p>

                     <p>But was not that Reaſon preſent to thoſe who look within themſelves, and had not the very <hi>Heathens</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally had ſome union with the Order we are ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of: What Sin or what Diſobedience could they have been guilty of, and according to what Juſtice could God puniſh them? I ſay this the rather becauſe a Prophet tells me, That God himſelf is willing to make Men Judges of the Difference he has with his People, provided they paſs their Judgment according to the immutable and neceſſary Order of Juſtice.<note place="margin">Nunc ergo habit ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem &amp; viri Juda Judicate inter me &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dram meam. <hi>Esa. 5.3.</hi>

                        <hi>Nero</hi> kill'd his Mother, 'tis true, But wherein has he done ill? He followed the Natural motion of his Hatred: God gave him no Precept to the contrary: The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law was not made for him. Perhaps it may be urged, that the Law of Nature forbids the like Action, and that the ſaid Law was known to him. But what proof have we of it? For my part I grant it, becauſe that really and invincibly proves there is an immutable and neceſſary Order; and that every Mind or Spirit has a knowledge of this Order, which is the more clear, in that it is more united to the univerſal Reaſon, and becauſe it is leſs ſenſible of the Impreſſions of Senſe and of the Paſſions; in a word, becauſe it is more reaſonable. But I muſt endeavour to explain my Sentiment, concerning Order and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Natural Law, as clearly as poſſible I can: For the Reaſon why Men are ſo backward to ſubſcribe to what I ſay, is perhaps becauſe they do not diſtinctly perceive what I think.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that God contains within himſelf, after an intelligible manner, the perfections of all Beings he has created or can create; and that it is by theſe intelligible perfections he knows the Eſſence of all things, as by his own Will he knows their Exiſtence. Thoſe perfections are likewiſe the immediate Object of the Mind of Man, for the Reaſons above-ſaid. Therefore the intelligible Ideas, or the perfections Which are in God, and which repreſent unto us that which is out of God, are abſolutely neceſſary and immutable. Now thoſe Truths are only the relations of equality or inequality which are among thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:107782:211"/>Beings; ſince it is only true that 2 times 2 make 4, or that 2 times 2 are not 5; becauſe there is a relation of equality between 2 times 2 and 4, and one of inequality between 2 times 2 and 5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Truths are immutable and neceſſary as well as their Ideas. It has always been true that 2 and 2 make 4, and it is impoſſible it ſhould become falſe. This is evident, without the leaſt neceſſity <hi>of God's having Eſtabliſhed thoſe Truths as Supream Law-giver;</hi> as Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſays in his Anſwer to the Sixth Objection.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſie enough to apprehend what Truth is; but Men have much ado to conceive what the immutable and neceſſary Order is; what Natural and Divine Law is; what God neceſſarily Wills, as alſo what the Righteous Will. For that which makes a Man Juſt, is that he loves Order, and conforms his Will to it in all things: As the Sinner is only ſo, becauſe he does not approve of Order in all things; and that he would fain have it to be conformable to what he wiſhes. Nevertheleſs there is not ſo great a Myſtery in thoſe things, in my opinion, as Men imagine: And I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the reaſon why they find ſo many difficulties in it, proceeds from the difficulty the Mind finds to raiſe it ſelf to Abſtracted and Metaphiſical Thoughts, This is partly what I think of Order.</p>
                     <p>It is evident, that the Perfections that are in God, which repreſent created or poſſible Beings, are not all alike: That thoſe (for Inſtance,) which repreſent Bodies, are not ſo Noble as thoſe which repreſent Spirits: And that even among thoſe which only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Bodies or Spirits, ſome are more perfect than others <hi>ad Infinitum.</hi> This is clearly, and without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, conceived; though it is not eaſie to reconcile the ſimplicity of the Divine Being with that variety of intelligible Ideas which it includes in its Wiſdom. For it is evident, that if all the Ideas of God were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, he could ſee no difference among his Works; ſince he can only ſee his Creatures by that which is in him which repreſents them; and if the Idea of a Watch which, beſides the Hours, ſhows all the different
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:107782:211"/>Motions of the Planets, were not more perfect than that of a Watch which only points out the Hours, or than that of a Circle or a Square, a Watch would not be more perfect than a Circle. For we can only judge of the perfection of Works by the perfection of the Ideas we have of them: And if there were no more wiſdom or ſign of underſtanding in a Watch than in a Circle, it would not be more difficult to conceive the moſt compounded Machines, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Square or a Circle.</p>
                     <p>If it be true then that God, who is the Univerſal Being, includes within himſelf all Beings after an intelligible manner; and that all theſe intelligible Beings which have a neceſſary Exiſtence in God, are not equally perfect; it is evident, that there muſt be an immutable and neceſſary Order among them: And that in the ſame manner as there are Eternal and neceſſary Truths, becauſe there are relations of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude amongſt intelligible Beings, there muſt alſo be an immutable and neceſſary Order, by reaſon of the relations of Perfection which are among the ſame Beings. 'Tis then an immutable Order, that Spirits ſhould be Nobler than Bodies, as it is a neceſſary Truth, that 2 times 2 are 4, or that 2 times 2 are not 5.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the immutable Order ſeems rather to be a ſpeculative Truth than a neceſſary Law. For if Order be only conſidered as we have now done it, it is plain, for Inſtance, that 'tis a Truth that Spirits are Nobler than Bodies: But we do not ſee that this Truth is at the ſame time an Order bearing the force of a Law, and that we are obliged to prefer Spirits before Bodies. Therefore we muſt conſider, that God loves himſelf by a neceſſary Love, and for that Reaſon loves that better in himſelf that includes and repreſents more Perfection, than that which includes leſs. So that if we would ſuppoſe that an intelligible Spirit was a thouſand times more perfect than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Body, the Love by Which God loves himſelf, would of neceſſity be a thouſand times greater for that Spirit, than for this intelligible Body: For the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:107782:212"/>Love of God is neceſſarily proportioned to the Order which is between the intelligible Being he includes. So that Order which is purely ſpeculative has the force of a Law in relation to God himſelf; ſuppoſing, as it is certain, that God neceſſarily loves himſelf, and cannot love intelligible Bodies more than intelligible Spirits, though he may love created Bodies more than created Spirits, as I ſhall ſhow hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Now this immutable Order which has the force of a Law in reſpect to God himſelf, has viſibly the force of a Law in relation to us. For this Order is known to us, and our natural Love ſuits it ſelf to it, when we look into our ſelves, and when our Senſes and Paſſions leave us free: In a word, when our Self-love does not corrupt our natural Love. Being made for God, from whom we can never be abſolutely ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, we ſee this Order in him, and are naturally inclined to love him: For it is his Light which lightens us, and his Love which animates us, though our Senſes, and Paſſions obſcure that Light, and determine againſt Order the impreſſion which we receive to love ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Order. But though Concupiſcence conceals Order from us, and hinders us from following it, yet it is ſtill an Eſſential and Indiſpenſible Law in reſpect to us: And not only in reſpect of us, but to all created Intelligences, and even in reſpect of the Damned. For I do not think they are ſo far remov'd from God, but that they ſtill preſerve ſome ſmall Idea of Order, ſtill find ſome Beauty in it; nay more, are ſtill ready to conform to it in ſome particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which do not oppoſe their Self-love.</p>
                     <p>The Corruption of the Heart conſiſts in an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Order. Therefor the Malice or Corruption of the Will not being equal even among the Damned, it is evident that they are not equally oppoſed to Order, nor hate it in all things, unleſs in Conſequence of the hatred they bear to God, For as no Man can hate Good, conſidered barely as ſuch; ſo none can hate Order, unleſs it proves contrary to their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But, though it ſeems contrary to their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:107782:212"/>nevertheleſs it is a Law which condemns them, and which even puniſhes them everlaſtingly.</p>
                     <p>We now ſee what Order is, and how it has the force of a Law by the neceſſary Love God has for himſelf. We conceive how this Law is General for all Spirits, and even for God himſelf: How it is neceſſary and abſolutely indiſpenſible. In fine, We either do or may eaſily conceive in general, how it is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all Divine and Humane Laws, and that it is according to this Law, all Intelligences are Judged, and all Creatures diſpoſed in their reſpective Claſſes that are proper for them.</p>
                     <p>I own, it is no eaſie Task to explain all this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, neither will I venture to undertake it: For ſhould I attempt to ſhow the relation particular Laws have to the General Law, and the Connection between certain Proceedings and Order; I ſhould be obliged to enter into ſuch difficulties, as perhaps I ſhould not be able to ſolve, and which would alſo lead me far from my Subject.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, if we conſider that God neither has nor can have any Law but his Wiſdom, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Love he has for it, we ſhall eaſily conclude, that all Divine Laws muſt be grounded on it. And if we obſerve, that he has only made the World in relation to that Wiſdom and Love, ſince he only Acts for himſelf; we ſhall no longer doubt but that all Natural Laws muſt tend to the preſervation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this World, according to indiſpenſable Order, and by their dependance on neceſſary Love: For all things are governed by the Wiſdom and Will of God.</p>
                     <p>There is no neceſſity for me to inlarge any further on this Principle at this time. What I have ſaid is ſufficient to draw this Conſequence, That in the firſt Inſtitution of Nature, it was impoſſible that Spirits ſhould have been ſubjected to Bodies: For as God can never Act without Knowledge and involuntarily, ſo he has made the World according to his Wiſdom and by the Morion of his Love: He has made all things by his Son, and in the Holy Ghoſt, as the Scripture teaches us. Now, in the Wiſdom of God, Spirits are
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:107782:213"/>more perfect than Bodies, and by the neceſſary Love which God has for himſelf, he prefers the moſt perfect to the leaſt perfect, Therefore it is impoſſible that Spirits ſhould have been ſubjected to Bodies in the firſt Inſtitution of Nature. Otherwiſe we ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſay, That when God made the World he followed not the Rules of his Eternal Wiſdom, nor the Motions of his natural and neceſſary Love: Which is not to be conceived, but rather implies a direct Contradiction.</p>
                     <p>It is true, at preſent a created Mind is ſubject to a material and ſenſible Body; but it is becauſe Order conſidered as a neceſſary Law, requires it. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, God loving himſelf by a neceſſary Love, which is alwayes his inviolable Law, cannot love Spirits which are contrary to him; nor conſequently prefer them to Bodies, in which there is no ill, nor any thing that God hates.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See the fifth Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of</hi> The Chriſtian Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</note> For God loves not Sinners in themſelves; they only ſubſiſt in the Univerſe by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> God only preſerves and loves them, that they may ceaſe to be Sinners by Grace in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Or that if they remain Sinners eternally, they may eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be condemned by the immutable and neceſſary Order, and by the Judgment of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> through whoſe Power they ſubſiſt, for the Glory of Divine Juſtice; for were it not for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> they would be annihilated. I ſay this by the by, to remove ſome difficulties which may remain about what I have ſaid elſewhere concerning Original Sin; or the general Corruption of Nature.</p>
                     <p>It is, in my Opinion, very uſeful to conſider that the Mind only knows External Objects after two manners: By Knowledge and by Senſations. It ſees things by Knowledge, when it has a clear Idea of them, and conſulting this Idea, can diſcover all the properties they are capable of. It ſees things by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, when it cannot thus diſcover the properties of them clearly: When it only knows them by a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Senſation, without Light and Evidence. It is by Knowledge and' a clear Idea, the Mind ſees the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:107782:213"/>of Things, Numbers and Extenſion. It is by a confuted Idea or by Senſation, it judges of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of Creatures, and that it knows its <hi>own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Mind perceives thoſe things perfectly which it perceives by Knowledge and a clear Idea; and moreover it ſees clearly, that if there be any obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or imperfection in its Knowledge, it proceeds from its weakneſs and limitation; or from want of application on its part, and not for want of perfection in the Idea which it perceives. But what the Mind perceives by Senſation, is never clearly known to it: Not for want of application on its part, for we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes apply our ſelves carefully to what we feel, but by the defect of the Idea which is very obſcure and confuſed.</p>
                     <p>From hence we may judge, that it is in God, or in an immutable Nature, that we ſee whatever we know by Light and a clear Idea; not only becauſe by Knowledge we ſee Number, Extenſion, and the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Beings, which depend not on a firſt act of God, as I have already ſhow'd; but alſo becauſe we know thoſe things after a very perfect manner, and alſo we ſhould know them after an infinitely perfect manner, were the capacity we have of thinking, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, ſince nothing is wanting in the Idea which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents them. We ought alſo to conclude, that it is in our ſelves we ſee whatever we know by Senſation: Not that we can produce any new Modification in our ſelves, or that the Senſations or Modifications of our Soul can repreſent objects, by whoſe means God excites them in us; but becauſe our Senſations which are not diſtinct from us, and conſequently can never repreſent any thing that is diſtinct from us, may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs repreſent the exiſtence of Beings, or make us judge that they do exiſt. For, God exciting our Senſation in us at the preſence of Objects by an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is no wiſe ſenſible, we fancy we receive from the Object not only the Idea which repreſents its. Eſſence, but alſo the Senſation which makes us judge of its Exiſtence; for there is alwayes a pure
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:107782:214"/>Idea and a confuſed Senſation in the knowledge we have of the Exiſtence of Beings, if we except that of God and our Soul. I except the Exiſtence of God; for that is known by a pure Idea, without Senſation; his Exiſtence not depending on a Cauſe, and being included in the Idea of the neceſſary Being, as the equality of Diameters is included in the Idea of the Circle. I alſo except the Exiſtence of our own Soul; becauſe we know by an Internal Senſation that we think, will, and feel; and that we have no clear Idea of our Soul; as I have ſufficiently explained in the Seventh Chapter of the Second Part of the Third Book, and elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are part of the Reaſons that may be added to thoſe I had already given to prove, that God only inlightens us; and that the immediate and direct ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our clear and evident Knowledge, is an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and neceſſary Nature.

                           <p>I wonder that the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> who have ſo much, and yet ſo reaſonable an averſion, againſt the general Expreſſions of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Faculty,</hi> ſo freely uſe them on this occaſion. They will not allow Men to ſay, that Fire burns by its <hi>Nature,</hi> and that it turns certain Bodies into Glaſs by a Natural <hi>Faculty:</hi> And yet ſome of them are not afraid of ſaying, that the Mind of Man produces in it ſelf the Ideas of all things by its <hi>Nature,</hi> and becauſe it has the <hi>Faculty</hi> of Thinking. But yet they muſt give me liberty to ſay, that theſe Expreſſions are no more ſignificant in their Mouths, than in thoſe of the <hi>Peripatetics.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I am ſenſible the Soul is capable of Thinking; but I know alſo that Extenſion is capable of Figures. The Soul is capable of volition, as well as Matter is of motion. But, as it is falſe that Matter, though capable of Figure and Motion, has in it ſelf a <hi>Power,</hi> a <hi>Faculty,</hi> a <hi>Nature,</hi> by which it can move it ſelf, or aſſume ſometimes a round Figure, and ſometimes a ſquare one; ſo that the Soul is Naturally and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially capable of Knowledge and of Volition; yet it is falſe that it has <hi>Faculties</hi> by which it can produce its Ideas in its ſelf, or its tendency towards good. There is a great difference between being Movable, and Moving. Matter of its Nature is moveable, and capable of Figures: Beſides it cannot ſubſiſt without Figure. But it moves not it ſelf; it gives not it ſelf a Figure; it has no <hi>Faculty</hi> for all that. The Mind by its Nature is capable of Motion and Ideas: I grant it: But it moves not it ſelf; it inlightens not it ſelf: God does all in Spirits as well as in Bodies. Can we ſay, that God makes all the alterations which happen in Matter,<note place="margin">See the firſt <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</hi>
                              </note> and that he makes not thoſe which happen in the Mind? Do we give that unto God which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, in abandoning the laſt of all Beings to his Diſpoſition? Is he not equally the Maſter of all
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:107782:215"/>things? Is he not the Creator, the Preſerver, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Mover of Spirits as well as Bodies? Certainly he makes all things, Subſtances, Accidents, Beings, manners of Beings. We take away his Knowledge, by putting bounds to his Action.</p>
                           <p>But if Men will needs have it, that Creatures have ſuch <hi>Faculties</hi> is are commonly conceived; that we muſt ſay that Natural Bodies have a <hi>Nature</hi> which is the Author of their Motion and Reſt, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his followers ſay. This overthrows all my Ideas: But yet I would rather allow it, than ſay, that the Mind inlightens it ſelf. Let Men ſay, the Soul has that power of differently moving the Members of their Body, and to communicate Senſation and Life to them: Let them ſay, if they pleaſe, that it gives Heat to the Blood, Motion to the Spirits, and to the reſt of the Body its Magnitude, Diſpoſition, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: But let them never ſay, that the Mind gives it ſelf its Motion and Light. If God does not all, at leaſt let us allow him to do that which is greateſt and moſt perfect in the World. And if Creatures do ſomething, let them move their Bodies, and let them order them as they pleaſe, but let them not act upon Minds.</p>
                           <p>Let us ſay, that Bodies move one another, after having moved themſelves: Or rather, let us not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to underſtand the different diſpoſitions of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that little concerns us. But we ought not to ſuffer our Minds to be ignorant from whom they receive the Light which lightens them: Let them know from whom they receive that which can make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and more perfect: Let them know their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance according to its utmoſt extent; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have actually, they receive it from God every moment: For as a great Saint ſayes upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subject; <hi>It is a very criminal Pride to make uſe of thoſe things which God gives us, as if they were Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ours.</hi> Above all things, let us not imagine that the Senſes inſtruct our Reaſon; that the Body directs the Mind; and that the Soul receives that from the
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:107782:215"/>Body which it has not it ſelf. It were better to fancy our ſelves independant, than to think we have a real dependance on the Body. It is better to be our own Maſter, than to ſeek out a Maſter among the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that is leſs valuable than we. But it is much better yet to ſubmit to the Eternal Truth, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us in the Goſpel, that he is our only Maſter, than to give credit to the teſtimony of our Senſes, or of ſome Men who dare ſpeak to us as our Maſters. Experience, whatever Men may ſay, does not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance Prejudices: For our Senſes, as well as our Maſters according to the Fleſh, are only occaſional cauſes of the inſtruction which the Eternal Wiſdom gives us in the moſt ſecret part of our Reaſon. But whereas that Wiſdom teaches us by an operation which is no wiſe ſenſible; we fancy that it is our Eyes, or the Worlds of thoſe who ſtrike the Air at our Ears which produce that Light, or pronounce that intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Voice which inſtructs us. 'Tis for that Reaſon, as I have ſaid elſewhere, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was not only ſatisfied with inſtructing us after an intelligible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by his Divinity; he thought fit alſo to inſtruct us after a ſenſible one by his Humanity: He would ſhow us that he was our Maſter in all things. And becauſe we cannot eaſily look within our ſelves, to conſult him as Eternal Truth, Immutable Order, and Intelligible Light; he has made Truth ſenſible by his Words, Order lovely by his Example, Light vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by a Body which diminiſhes the ſplendour of it; and yet we are ſtill ſo ingrateful, ſo injuſt, ſo ſtupid and ſenſleſs, as to look not only upon other Men, as our Maſters, contrary to his expreſs prohibition, but perhaps, even upon the moſt deſpicable and vile Bodies.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Do we not ſee that there is this difference between God and the Soul of Man, that God is an Unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Univerſal and Infinite Being, and that the Soul is a particular Species of Being? 'Tis one of the Properties of Infinity to be at once one, and all things, compoſed as it were of an Infinity of Perfections; and ſo ſimple, that every Perfection it poſſeſſes, includes all others without any real diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for as every Divine Perfection is Infinite, it conſtitutes the whole Divine Being. But the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Limited Being, it cannot have Extenſion in it ſelf, without becoming Material. Therefore God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in himſelf all Bodies after an intelligible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: He ſees their Eſſences or Ideas in his Wiſdom, and their Exiſtence in his Love, or in his Will. It is neceſſary to ſay ſo, ſince God made Bodies, and knows what he has made, even before any thing was made. But the Soul cannot ſee that within it ſelf, which it does not include: Moreover it cannot clearly ſee that which it does include; it can only feel it confuſedly. But to explain this.</p>
                           <p>The Soul does not include intelligible Extenſion, as one of its manners of Being; becauſe Extenſion is not a manner of Being, it is really a Being. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Extenſion alone, or without thinking on any thing elſe; but we cannot conceive manners of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without perceiving the Subject or Being, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are the manners. We perceive that Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:107782:216"/>without thinking on our Mind; beſides we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive Extenſion can be a Modification of ones Mind. Extenſion being limited makes ſome figure, and the limits of the Mind cannot be figured. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion having parts may be divided, at leaſt in ſome ſenſe, and we ſee nothing in the Soul that is diviſible. Therefore Extenſion which we ſee, is not a manner pf the Minds Being; and therefore cannot ſee it in it ſelf. How is it poſſible to ſee in one kind of Being all ſorts of Beings; and in one particular and finite Being, a Triangle in general and an infinite number of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles? For in fine, the Soul perceives a Triangle or a Circle in general, though it implyes a contradiction, that the Soul could have a Modification in general. The Senſations of Colour which the Soul aſcribes to Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, make them particular, becauſe none of the Modifications of a particular Being can be general.</p>
                           <p>Certainly we may affirm what we conceive clearly. We clearly conceive, that Extenſion which we ſee, is a thing diſtinct from us. Therefore we may ſay, that Extenſion is no Modification of our Being, and it is really ſomething that is diſtinct from us. For we muſt obſerve, that the Sun (for inſtance) which we ſee, is not that which we behold. The Sun, and whatever is in the material World, is not viſible in it ſelf; I have proved it elſewhere. The Soul cannot ſee the Sun to which it is immediately united. Now we clearly ſee, and plainly feel, that the Sun is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſtinct from us. Therefore we ſpeak againſt our Knowledge and our Conſcience, when we ſay, that the Soul ſees all Bodies which ſurround it in its own Modifications.</p>
                           <p>Pleaſure, Pain, Taſte, Heat, Colour, all our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and Paſſions, are Modifications of our Soul. But though they are ſo, do we know them clearly? Can we compare Heat with Taſte, Odour with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour? Can we diſtinguiſh the affinity there is between Red and Green, and even between Green and Green? It is not ſo with Figures; we compare them one with another; we exactly know their proportions;
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:107782:217"/>we preciſely perceive that the Square of the Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of a Square is double to that Square. What affinity can there be between thoſe intelligible Figures, which are very clear Ideas, and the Modifications of our Soul, which are only confuſed Senſations? And why ſhould we pretend that thoſe intelligible Figures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perceived by the Soul, unleſs they are Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it, ſince the Soul knows nothing of what happens to it by clear Ideas, but only by Conſcience or Internal Senſation, as I have proved elſewhere, and ſhall prove it again in the following Explanation. If we could only ſee the Figure of Bodies in our ſelves, they would on the contrary be unintelligible to us; for we know not our ſelves. We are only darkneſs to our ſelves, and muſt look out of our ſelves to ſee our ſelves; and we ſhall never know what we are, until we conſider our ſelves in him who is our Light, and in whom all things become Light. For it is only in God that the moſt material Beings are perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible; but out of him the moſt Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances become abſolutely inviſible. The Idea of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion which we ſee in God is very clear. But as we do not ſee the Idea of our Soul in God, we feel indeed that we are, and what we actually have: But it is impoſſible for us to diſcover what we are, or any of the Modifications whereof we are capable.</p>

Therefore it is not that intelligible Sun we ſee, it is the ſame with other Creatures. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee not the Works of God in God.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>To Anſwer all this, it's enough to conſider only, That God includes in himſelf an infinity intelligible Extenſion; for God knows Extenſion ſince he has made it, and he can only know it in himſelf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Mind can perceive part of that intelligible Extenſion which God includes, 'tis certain it may perceive all Figures in God; for all finite intelligible Extenſion is neceſſarily an intelligible Figure, ſince Figure is only the Expreſſion of Extenſion. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this Figure of intelligible and general Extenſion becomes ſenſible and particular by Colour, or ſome other ſenſible Quality which the Soul fixes to it; for the Soul commonly beſtows its Senſation upon the Idea which ſtrikes it lively. Therefore it is not neceſſary there ſhould be ſenſible Bodies in God, or Figures in intelligible Extenſions to ſee them in God, or to make God ſee them, though he only beholds himſelf.</p>
                           <p>If we conceive alſo, that a Figure of intelligible Extenſion made ſenſible by Colour, is taken ſucceſſively from the different parts of this infinite Extenſion: Or if we conceive, that a Figure of intelligible Extenſion may turn upon its Center, or ſucceſſively approach to another, we perceive the Motion of a ſenſible or intelligible Figure, without any Motion in intelligible Extenſion. For God ſees not the Motion of Bodies in his Subſtance, or in the Idea he has of it himſelf, but only by the knowledge he has of his Will in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, Moreover, He only ſees their Exiſtence that way, becauſe it is his Will only which gives a Being to all things. The Will of God changes nothing in his Subſtance: It moves it not. Intelligible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion is immoveable in all reſpects, even intelligibly. But though we only ſee this intelligible Extenſion, it ſeems moveable to us by reaſon of the ſenſation of Colour, or of the confuſed image which remains after the ſenſation, which we affix ſucceſſively, to diverſe
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:107782:218"/>parts of intelligible Extenſion, which gives us an Idea when we ſee or imagine the Motion of ſome Bodies.</p>
                           <p>One may eaſily apprehend, by what I have now ſaid, why we may ſee the Sun, ſometimes larger, and ſometimes ſmaller, though it be always the ſame in relation to God. For to do this, we need only ſee ſometimes a greater part of intelligible Extenſion, and ſometimes a leſſer; and have a more lively ſenſation of Light, to affix to that part of Extenſion. Now as the parts of intelligible Extenſion are all of the ſame nature, they may all repreſent any Body whatever.</p>
                           <p>You muſt not imagine, that the intelligible World has ſuch an Affinity with the material and ſenſible one, as that (for inſtance) there ſhould be an intelligible Sun, a Horſe, a Tree deſtin'd to repreſent to us a Sun, a Horſe, a Tree: And that all thoſe who ſee the Sun, do of neceſſity ſee this pretended intelligible Sun. As all intelligible Extenſions may be conceived circular, or have the intelligible Figure of a Horſe or a Tree; any intelligible Extenſion may ſerve to repreſent a Sun, a Horſe, a Tree, and conſequently be a Sun, a Horſe, a Tree of the intelligible World; and even become a viſible and ſenſible Sun, Horſe, or Tree, if the Soul have any ſenſation, occaſioned by Bodies, to affix to theſe Ideas.</p>
                           <p>Therefore when I ſaid, That we ſee different Bodies, by the knowledge we have of the Perfections of God which repreſent them; I did not mean directly, that there are certain particular Ideas in God, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent every Body in particular; and that we ſee ſuch an Idea, when we ſee ſuch a Body: For it is certain, we could not ſee that Body ſometimes large, and ſometimes ſmall, ſometimes round, and ſometimes ſquare, if we ſaw it by a particular Idea, which would be always the ſame. But I ſay, that we ſee all things in God, by the application that God makes of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Extent to our Mind, after a thouſand different ways; and thus intelligible Extenſion contains in it ſelf all Perfections, or rather all the Differences of Bodies, by means of the different Senſations which the Soul
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:107782:218"/>beſtows on the Ideas it has upon the account of thoſe very Bodies. I have ſpoken after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: But the World may conclude, that it was only to make ſome of my Proofs the ſtronger and more ſenſible; and we muſt not judge, by what I have ſaid now, that thoſe Proofs are no longer valid.

                           <p>I dare not ingage my ſelf to inlarge further upon this Subject, for fear of ſaying things that are too abſtruſe or extraordinary: Or rather, becauſe I would not venture to ſay things which I do not know, and which I am not capable of diſcovering; there are only ſome Paſſages of Scripture which ſeem to be contrary to what I have eſtabliſhed here, which I ſhall endeavour to explain.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>It is evident, That the Literal Senſe of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is not contrary to what I have ſaid hitherto: For I pretend not that we can ſee God in this Life, in the manner <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired it. I Anſwer neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that we muſt Dye to ſee God: For the Soul unites it ſelf to Truth, proportionably as it forſakes the Body: 'Tis a Truth which we do not ſufficiently think upon. Thoſe who follow the motions of their Paſſions, whoſe Imagination is ſullyed by the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pleaſures, who have augmented the Union and Correſpondence of their Mind with their Body; in a word, <hi>thoſe who Live,</hi> cannot ſee God: For they cannot look within themſelves there to conſult Truth.<note place="margin">Sapientia non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venitur in terra ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viter viventium. <hi>Job 18.</hi>
                              </note> Therefore happy are thoſe who have a pure Heart, whoſe Mind is free, and whoſe Imagination is clean, who are not tyed to the World, and hardly to their Body; in a word, happy are thoſe <hi>who are Dead,</hi> for they ſhall ſee God. Wiſdom has declared it publickly upon the Mountain, and it alſo ſayes it ſecretly to thoſe who conſult it by looking within themſelves.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe who continually excite Concupiſcence and Pride in themſelves, who perpetually form a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ambitious deſigns, who not only unite but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their Soul not only to their Body, but to all things which are about them; in a word; thoſe who <hi>live</hi> not only a <hi>Bodily Life,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Life
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:107782:221"/>of this World,</hi> cannot ſee God: For Wiſdom inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits the moſt ſecret part of Reaſon, but thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually incline towards external things.</p>
                           <p>Yet thoſe who continually mortifie the Activity of their Senſes, who are careful to preſerve the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Imagination, who couragiouſly reſiſt the Motions of their Paſſions; in a word, thoſe who break all the Tyes which make others Slaves to the Body and ſenſible Greatneſs, may diſcover a World of Truths, and ſee that Wiſdom <hi>which is concealed from the Eyes of all Mortals.</hi>

                              </note> They do in ſome meaſure ceaſe to live when they look within themſelves. They quiet the Body when they approach to Truth. For the Mind of Man is ſituate after ſuch a manner, between God and Bodies, that it cannot leave Bodies without drawing near unto God; as it cannot run after them without remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him. But whereas we cannot quit the Body wholly before Death, I own we cannot be perfectly united to God before that time. We may now, according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſee God confuſedly, as in a Glaſs, but we cannot ſee him Face to Face: <hi>Non videbit me homo, &amp; vivet.</hi> Nevertheleſs we may ſee him <hi>ex parte,</hi> that is, confuſedly and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>
                           <p>We muſt nor imagine that <hi>Life</hi> is equal in all <hi>Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men,</hi> nor that it conſiſts in an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Point.<note place="margin">Videmus nunc per ſpeculum in aenigmate, tunc autem, facie ad faciem.

                              </note> The Dominion of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy over the Mind, which hinders us from uniting our ſelves to God by the Knowledge of Truth, is capable of <hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſs.</hi> The Soul is not equally united to the Body it animates, by its Senſations in all Men, nor to thoſe towards which it inclines by its Paſſions; and there are ſome who mortifie the Concupiſcence of Pleaſure and Pride in themſelves to that degree, that they hardly any longer have any relation to their Bodies or to the World.
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:107782:221"/>Thus they are as if they were <hi>Dead.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives us a great Example of this. He chaſtized his Body, and reduced it into ſubjection; and he had humbled and leſſened himſelf to that degree, that he thought no more on the World, nor the World on him: For the World was Dead and Crucified to him, as he was Dead and Crucified to the World. And 'tis for that Reaſon, ſayes Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> that he was ſo ſenſible of Truth, and ſo well diſpoſed to receive the Divine Lights that are in his Epiſtles, which as bright as they are, only ſtrike thoſe who like him mortifie their Senſes and Paſſions: For as he ſayes himſelf, <hi>The carnal and ſenſible Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend ſpiritual things;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Animalis homo non percipit ea quae ſunt Spiritus Dei, ſtulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia enim eſt illi, <hi>1 Cor. 2.14.</hi>
                              </note> becauſe the Wiſdom of the World, the Taſte of the Age, Wit, Niceneſs, Vivacity, the Beauty of Imagination, by which we live to the World, and the World lives in us,<note place="margin">Ad <hi>Moyſen</hi> dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non videbit me homo &amp; vivet; ae ſi apertè diceretur; Nullus unquam Deum ſpiritualiter videt qui Mundo carnaliter vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. <hi>St.</hi> Greg. <hi>upon the 28th Chapter of</hi> Job.</note> communicates to our Mind a ſad ſtupidity and inſenſibility in reſpect to all Truths, which we cannot perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand without ſilencing our Senſes and Paſſions.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we muſt wiſh for Death which unites us to God, or at leaſt the Image of that Death, which is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Sleep, during which all our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senſes being ſtupified, we may liſten to the Voice of inward Truth, which is only heard in the ſilence of Night, when Darkneſs conceals ſenſible Objects from us, and the World is as it were Dead in relation to us. 'Tis thus, ſayes St. <hi>Gregory, That the Spouſe had hearkened to the Voice of her Beloved in her Sleep; at if ſhe had ſaid, I ſleep, but my Heart wakes. I ſleep outwardly, but my Heart wakes within me; becauſe having no Life, nor Senſation, in reference to viſible Objects, I become extreamly ſenſible to the Voice of inward Truth, which ſpeaks to me in the moſt ſecret part of my Reaſon.

                  <head>AN EXPLANATION OF THE Seventh Chapter of the Second Part of the Third Book.</head>
                  <head type="sub">
                     <hi>In which I prove,</hi> That we have no clear Idea of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Modifications of our Soul.</head>
                  <p>I Have ſaid in ſome places, and alſo think I have ſufficiently proved it in the Third Book of the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> that we have no clear Idea of our Soul, but only a <hi>Conſcience</hi> or Internal Senſation; and for that reaſon we know it far more Imperfectly than Extenſion. That appear'd ſo evident to me, that I did not think there was any neceſſity to prove it more at large. But the Authority of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> who ſays poſitively, <hi>That the Nature of the Mind is better known than that of all other things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer to the fifth Objection againſt the ſecond Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end.</note> has prejudiced ſome of his Diſciples ſo far, that what I have written about it has had no other effect with them, than to make me paſs for a weak Man, and one that is incapable of reaching and keeping firmly to abſtracted Truths, which are improper to beget and preſerve the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who conſider them.</p>
                  <p>I own that I am very weak, ſenſible and heavy, and that my Mind depends on my Body in ſo many
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:107782:223"/>reſpects that I cannot expreſs them. I know it, I feel it, and I endeavour continually to increaſe that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I have of my ſelf. For if we cannot prevent our being miſerable, it is neceſſary at leaſt to know it, and to feel it; ſince we muſt at leaſt humble our ſelves at the ſight of our inward Miſeries, and acknowledge the need we have to be delivered from this Body of Death, which diſperſes Trouble and Confuſion throughout all the Faculties of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs the Queſtion in hand is ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the Mind, that I ſee not why a great application is required to reſolve it: And this is the reaſon I did not inlarge upon it. For I think I may preſume to ſay, that the Ignorance of moſt Men in relation to their Soul, its diſtinction from the Body, its Spirituality, its Immortality, and its other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſufficiently prove that we have no clear or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Idea of it.</p>
                  <p>We may ſay we have a clear Idea of the Body, becauſe we need only to conſult the Idea which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it to diſcover the modifications whereof it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. We ſee clearly that it may be round, ſquare, at reſt, or in motion. We eaſily conceive that a Square may be divided into two Triangles, two Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams, two Trapezias. When any one asks us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing belongs, or belongs not to Extenſion, we never heſitate upon an Anſwer; becauſe the Idea of Extenſion being clear, we eaſily at firſt ſight ſee what it contains, and what it excludes.</p>
                  <p>But I find not that we have any Idea of our Mind, by which we may diſcover in conſulting it, the modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications whereof it is capable. Had we never felt Pleaſure or Pain we ſhould not be able to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soul were, or were not capable of feeling them. If a Man had never eaten Melon, ſuffered Pain, ſeen Red or Blue, he might conſult the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Idea of his Soul long enough, and never have diſtinctly diſcovered from thence, whether it were capable or not of ſuch ſenſations and ſuch modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I ſay further, although he actually felt Pain, or ſaw Colour, he could not by a ſimple view diſcover
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:107782:223"/>if thoſe qualities belonged to the Soul. We imagine that Pain is in the Body, and that is the reaſon we ſuffer it; and that Colour is diffuſed through the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of Objects, although we very clearly conceive that theſe Objects are diſtinct from the Soul.</p>
                  <p>To be well aſſured whether ſenſible qualities are, or are not modifications of the Mind, we never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult this pretended Idea of the Soul: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the <hi>Carteſians</hi> themſelves conſult the Idea of Extenſion; and argue after this manner, Heat, Pain, and Colour, cannot be the modifications of Extenſion; for Extenſion is only capable of different Figures and different Motions. And there is but two kinds of Beings, that of Spirits and that of Bodies; therefore Pain, Heat, Colour, and all other ſenſible qualities belong to the Mind.</p>
                  <p>Since we are obliged to conſult the Idea we have of Extenſion, to diſcover whether or no ſenſible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are modifications of the Soul; is it not evident that we have no clear Idea of the Soul? Elſe we ſhould never bethink our ſelves of going ſo far about. When a Philoſopher would diſcover whether Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs belongs to Extenſion, does he conſult the Idea of his Soul, or any other Idea, than that of Extenſion? Does he not clearly ſee in the Idea of Extenſion it ſelf, that Roundneſs is a modification of it: And would it not be extravagant if he ſhould argue after this manner to explain it; that there is only two kinds of Beings, that of Spirits, and that of Bodies; but Roundneſs is not a modification of a Spirit, therefore 'tis a modification of a Body.</p>
                  <p>We diſcover then by one ſimple view, without reaſoning, by a bare application of the Mind to the Idea of Extenſion, that Roundneſs, and all other Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures whatever are modifications which belong to the Body; and that Pleaſure, Pain, Heat, and all other ſenſible qualities are not modifications thereof. No Queſtion can be propoſed about what does or does not belong to Extenſion, which cannot be anſwered eaſily, quickly, and boldly, by the conſideration only of the Idea which repreſents it. All Men are agreed
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:107782:224"/>upon what ought to be received about this ſubject. For thoſe who ſay that Matter can think, don't ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it has this faculty becauſe it is extended; ſince they acknowledge that Extenſion, taken preciſely as ſuch, cannot think.</p>
                  <p>But we are not ſo well agreed about what we ought to believe of the Soul, and its modifications: There are ſome who think Pain, Heat, or Colour does not ſo much as appertain to it. 'Twould ſeem very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous amongſt ſome <hi>Carteſians,</hi> to ſay the Soul actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becomes Blew, Red, or Yellow, or receives a tincture of the Colours of the Rainbow, whileſt it contemplates thereon. There are many perſons who doubt, and ſtill more who don't believe, that the Soul becomes actually ſtinking when we ſmell Carrion; and that the taſte of Sugar, Pepper, and Salt, are properties belonging to it. Where is then the clear Idea of the Soul, that the <hi>Carteſians</hi> may conſult it, and agree all upon the ſubject, where Colours, Taſte, Odours, &amp;c. ought to center.</p>
                  <p>Yet if the <hi>Carteſians</hi> were agreed upon this point, we could not conclude from thence that they would have a clear Idea of the Soul; for if they ſhould at laſt grant, that 'tis that which is actually Green, or Red, when we ſee Green or Red, yet would it be only by long and tedious reaſonings that they could conclude it: They would never diſcover it by a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple view, nor ever find it by conſulting the pretended Idea of the Soul, but rather by conſidering that of the Body. They only affirm that ſenſible qualities apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Soul, becauſe they belong not to Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof they have a clear Idea; nor could they ever otherwiſe convince thoſe of it, who having weak Minds, are incapable of complicated Perceptions or Arguments; or rather thoſe who cannot ſtay long on the clear Idea of the Body, but confound all things: There will be always Peaſants, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and perhaps even ſome Learned Men who will doubt of it. But Women and Children, Learned and Ignorant, the moſt Ingenious and moſt Stupid, plainly ſee by the Idea they have of Extenſion, that 'tis
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:107782:224"/>capable of all manner of Figures: And as clearly apprehend that Extenſion is not capable of Pain, Taſte, Smell, nor any Senſation, when they faithfully and with application conſult only the Idea which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it; for the Idea which repreſents Extenſion includes no ſenſible quality.</p>
                  <p>It is true they may doubt whether Bodies are or are not capable of Senſation, or of receiving any ſenſible quality: But then by the Body they mean ſomething elſe beſides Extenſion, and have no clear Idea of the Body taken in this ſenſe. But when <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> or the <hi>Carteſians</hi> to whom I ſpeak, affirm that they know the Soul better than the Body, only underſtand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion by the Body; then how can they maintain that we have a clearer knowledge of the Nature of the Soul, than we have of the Body, ſince the Idea of Body or Extenſion is ſo clear that all the World agrees on what it includes; and that of the Soul ſo confuſed, that the <hi>Carteſians</hi> themſelves every day diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the modifications of Colour, belong to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We know,</hi> ſay theſe Philoſophers according to <hi>Des Cartes, the nature of a ſubſtance ſo much the more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we know more of its Attributes: Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereof we know ſo many Attributes, as of our Mind; becauſe as many as we diſcover in any thing elſe, we may place to the account of the Mind, ſince it knows them: And therefore its Nature is more known than that of any other thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But who is there that don't ſee a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt knowing by a <hi>clear Idea,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>Conſcience?</hi> When I know that 2 times 2 are 4, I know it very clearly; but I don't clearly know what it is in me that knows it: It is true I feel that I know it by Conſcience or inward Senſation; but I have not ſo clear an Idea of it, as I have of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whoſe relations I can clearly diſcover. I can reckon three properties in my Mind, that of knowing that 2 times 2 are 4, that of knowing that 3 times 3 are 9, and that of knowing that 4 times 4 are 16. And if you will theſe three properties ſhall be different from one another, and thus I could count an infinite
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:107782:225"/>number of properties in my ſelf: but I deny that we <hi>clearly</hi> know the Nature of things which we cannot thus reckon.</p>
                  <p>We may ſay that we have the clear idea of a Being, and are acquainted with its Nature, when we can compare it with others, of which we alſo have a clear Idea; or at leaſt when we can compare the modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereof it is capable amongſt themſelves. We have clear Ideas of Numbers, and the parts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, becauſe we can compare theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. As we may compare 2 with 4, 4 with 16, and each number with any other; ſo we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Square with a Triangle, a Circle with an Ellipſis, a Square and a Triangle with any other Square and Triangle, and by this means clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the relations which theſe Figures and Numbers have to one another. But we cannot compare our Mind with other Beings, to diſcover clearly any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; nor can we ſo much as compare its modifications together. We can never clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the relations between Pleaſure and Pain, Heat and Colour, or to ſpeak only of the modifications of the ſame kind, we cannot exactly determine the relations between Green and Red, Yellow and Purple, nor even between Purple and Purple. We ſee plainly that one is darker or brighter than the other, yet do we not evidently know either how much, or what it is to be darker or brighter. We have therefore no clear Idea of the Soul or its modifications: and although I ſee or feel Colours, Taſts, Odours, I may ſay as I have before, that I know them not by a clear Idea, ſince I cannot clearly diſcover their relations.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true I can diſcover the exact relation between Sounds; as for inſtance, that the Octave is double, a fifth as 3 to 2, a fourth as 4 to 3. but I cannot know theſe proportions by the ſenſations I have of 'em. If I know the Octave is double 'tis becauſe I have learnt by experience that the ſame ſtring ſounds an Octave, when having ſtruck it whole, we ſtrike it again after having divided it into two equal parts; or that I know the number of vibrations is double in equal times, or
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:107782:225"/>ſomething of the like nature: and this becauſe the tremblings of the air, the vibration of the ſtring, and even the ſtring it ſelf are ſuch things as we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare by clear Ideas: and that we diſtinctly know the relations between the ſtring and its parts, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſwiftneſs of different vibrations. But we cannot compare Sounds amongſt themſelves, or as they are ſenſible Qualities and Modifications of the Soul; nor this way are their proportions or relations to be diſcovered. And although Muſicians very well diſtinguiſh the different concords, 'tis not becauſe they diſtinguiſh the proportions of them by clear Ideas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They judge of different Sounds only by the Ear, Reaſon has nothing to do in it. But we cannot ſay that the Ear judges by a clear Idea, or otherwiſe than by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Muſicians therefore have no clear Idea of Sounds as they are Senſations and Modifications of the Soul; and conſequently we conceive neither the Soul nor its Modifications by a clear Idea, but only by Conſcience or inward Senſation.</p>
                  <p>Nay, what is more, we do not ſo much as know wherein conſiſt thoſe Diſpoſitions of the Soul, which make it more ready to act and repreſent Objects to it ſelf; we cannot ſo much as diſcover in what theſe Diſpoſitions can conſiſt: Nor can we by Reaſon poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively affirm, whether the Soul alone ſeparated from the Body, or conſidered without relation to the Body, is capable of <hi>Habits</hi> and <hi>Memory.</hi> But how could we be ignorant of theſe things if the Nature of the Soul were better known to us than that of the Body? Without any difficulty we perceive wherein conſiſts the facility that the Animal Spirits have to flow into the Nerves they have been many times in; or at leaſt we eaſily diſcover that whilſt the Conduits of the Nerves are enlarged, and their Fibres recumbent after a certain manner, the Spirits can eaſily inſinuate themſelves. But what can we conceive to be capable of encreaſing the facility the Soul has to act or think? For my part I confeſs I am wholly ignorant of it, nor can I inſtruct my ſelf in it, although I have a very lively ſenſation of the facility whereby it excites cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:107782:226"/>thoughts in me: And if I had no particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which inclined me to believe that I really have ſuch Diſpoſitions although I know them not in me, I ſhould conclude that there was neither. Habit nor Spiritual Memory in my Soul. But in fine, ſince we have any doubt about it, it is a certain mark we are not ſo well acquainted with it as is pretended; for Doubts can never attend Evidence and clear Ideas.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that the moſt underſtanding Man does not evidently know,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.1.</note> whether he deſerves Love or Hatred as the Wiſe-man ſpeaks.<note place="margin">Sed neque meipſum judico. Nihil enim mihi conſcius ſum: ſed non in hoc juſtificatus ſum, qui autem judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat me, Dominus est, <hi>1 Cor. 4.4. John 13.37.</hi>
                     </note> The inward ſenſation we have of our ſelves can give us no aſſurance of it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays indeed his Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him with nothing, yet for all that he doeſ not ſay he is juſtified. On the contrary he affirms, that juſtifies him not, and that he durſt not judge himſelf, becauſe he who judges is the Lord. But as we have a clear Idea of Order, if we had as clear a one of the Soul by the inward ſenſation we have of our ſelves, we ſhould evidently know if it were conformable to order; we ſhould diſcover whether we were righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or not, and even exactly diſcern all its inward diſpoſitions to good or evil, whenever we had any ſenſation of them. And if we could know our ſelves as we are, we ſhould not be ſo ſubject to preſumption. 'Tis alſo very probable that then St. <hi>Peter</hi> would not have ſaid to his Maſter, whom he ſo ſoon after denied: <hi>Why can I not follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy ſake: Animam meam pro te ponam.</hi> For having an inward ſenſation of his Power and Good Will, he would have been able evidently to have ſeen whether he had had a ſufficient Strength and Courage in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have overcome death, or rather the inſults of a ſilly Maid, and two or three other Servants.</p>
                  <p>If the Nature of the Soul is more known than that of any thing elſe, and the Idea we have of it, as clear as that we have of the Body; I only demand, what is the reaſon that ſo many Men confound them together? Is it poſſible to confound two clear Ideas which are
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:107782:226"/>entirely different? Let us do Juſtice to all the World. Thoſe who are not of our Opinion are as rational as we, they have the ſame Idea of things, and partake of the ſame Reaſon. Why therefore do they confound what we diſtinguiſh? Do they ever on other occaſions confound ſuch Things as they have clear Ideas of? Have they ever confounded two different Numbers? Or ever taken a Square for a Circle? And yet the Soul differs more from the Body than a Square does from a Circle: for they are two Subſtances which agree in nothings and ſtill they confound them. The reaſon muſt be then becauſe there is ſome difficulty in diſcovering their difference; and which cannot be done by a ſimple view, but ſome Arguments muſt be uſed to prove that the one is not the other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Idea of Extenſion muſt be conſulted with application, and we muſt diſcover that it is not a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of Body, but the Body it ſelf, ſince it is repreſented to us as a Thing ſubſiſting, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of whatever we clearly conceive in Bodies: And that as the Modifications of Body is not capable of having any relations to ſenſible Qualities, ſo it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Subject of theſe Qualities, or rather the Being whereof theſe Qualities are Modifications, ſhould be very different from Body. The like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are neceſſary to be urged to prevent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding our Souls with our Bodies. But if we had as clear an Idea of the Soul as we have of the Body, certainly we need not be at all this trouble to diſtinguiſh them; ſince we ſhould diſcover their eſſential difference by one ſimple view, and with as much facility as we perceive the difference between a Square and a Circle.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſtand to prove more at large, that we have no clear Ideas either of the Soul or its Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for what ever way we conſider our ſelves we ſufficiently diſcover it. Nor had I added this to what I have already ſaid of it in the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> but that ſome <hi>Carteſians</hi> objected againſt it. If this does not ſatisfie them, I ſhall expect that they diſcover to me this clear Idea which I have not been able to find in my ſelf, although I have done what I could to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it.</p>

                  <head>AN EXPLANATION OF THE Eighth Chapter of the Second Part of the Third Book.</head>
                  <head type="sub">
                     <hi>Of Looſe and General Terms which ſignifie nothing, how they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from others.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>TO comprehend what has been ſaid in ſome places, how ſuch as explain Things by Logical and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Terms, give no Reaſon of them, we need only to conſider, that whatever <hi>is,</hi> may be reduced to <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Manner of Being,</hi> whatever Term ſignifies neither of theſe, ſignifies nothing at all; and whatever Term ſignifies neither of them diſtinctly and particularly ſignifies nothing diſtinct; this ſeems to me very clear and evident, but what is ſo in it ſelf, is not ſo to every one. Words are a ſort of Coin, wherwith Men pay themſelves and others, all Terms that offend not the Ear are currant, and there is ſo little Truth in the Buſineſs of the World, that thoſe who ſpeak, or hear it, have commonly no reſpect to it; The Gift of Speech is the greateſt Talent, and the Language of the Imagination is the ſureſt Means, and a Memory filled with Unintelligible Terms will always appear advantagiouſly whatever <hi>Carteſians</hi> may ſay of it.</p>
                  <pb n="747" facs="tcp:107782:227"/>
                  <p>When Men ſhall love Truth only, they will be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious what they ſay, carefully examine their Intentions, and ſcornfully reject Empty Terms, cloſely adhering to clear Ideas. But when will this come to paſs? Then only when their dependance upon the Body is broke, when their neceſſary relation to ſenſible Objects ceaſes, when they ſhall no longer corrupt one another, but faithfully conſult their Maſter who inſtructs them inwardly; but this is not to be expected in this life.</p>
                  <p>Yet all are not equally indifferent for Truth; ſome ſpeak without reflection, hear without diſtinction, and attend on that only which affects them; others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly labour to inform themſelves and convince others of the Truth. 'Tis to theſe chiefly that I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf; for it was at their Requeſts I began theſe Remarks.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then; Whatever <hi>is,</hi> whether it actually exiſts or not, and conſequently whatever is intelligible is either <hi>Being,</hi> or a <hi>Manner of Being.</hi> By <hi>Being</hi> I intend ſomething that is abſolute, or that may be conceived alone, independent of any thing elſe; by <hi>Manner of Being,</hi> I mean ſomething relative, or what cannot be conceived alone. Now there are two Manners of Being, one conſiſts in the relation of the parts of any Whole to ſome part of the ſame Whole, the other in the relation of one Thing to another which are not parts of the ſame Whole. An Inſtance of the <hi>firſt</hi> is Roundneſs in Wax, which conſiſts in the Equality of diſtance that all the Superficial parts have in reſpect to that at the Center. The Motion or Situation of the Wax is an Inſtance of the <hi>ſecond:</hi> which conſiſts in the relation which the Wax has to the Bodies that are about it. By Motion I mean, not a Moving Power; for 'tis evident that Power neither is, nor can be, a Manner of a Bodies Exiſtence; for let it be Modified how it will, we cannot conceive it as a <hi>Moving Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatever then is intelligible is either <hi>Being,</hi> or a <hi>Manner of Being;</hi> for it is certain, that every Expreſſion that ſignifies neither of theſe, ſignifies nothing at all, and every Term that ſignifies not this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Being, or Manner of Being, is obſcure and confuſed: danglam
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:107782:228"/>And therefore whatever we ſay to one another is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable, if we have no diſtinct Idea of <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Manner of Being,</hi> which reſpectively anſwer to the Terms made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>However I confeſs we may, and ought ſometimes to uſe ſuch Words as do not excite diſtinct Ideas. <hi>We may,</hi> becauſe 'tis not always neceſſary to put the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition inſtead of the Thing defined, and becauſe we may ſometimes profitably uſe abridg'd Expreſſions, though in themſelves confuſed. <hi>We muſt,</hi> as when we are obliged to ſpeak of ſuch Things whereof we have no diſtinct Idea, and which we conceive not by an inward ſenſation, as of the Soul and her Modifications, only we ought to be careful that we uſe not obſcure and equivocal Terms, we having clear ones, or even any which may excite falſe Ideas in thoſe we ſpeak to. For Inſtance:</p>
                  <p>It is more intelligible to ſay, that God created the World by his Will, than his Power. This laſt Word is a Logical Term which ſtirs up no diſtinct and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Idea, but leaves us at liberty to imagine that the Power of God may be diſtinct from the Efficacy of his Will. We ſpeak more intelligibly when we ſay, God pardons Sinners through Jeſus Chriſt, than by abſolutely ſaying, He forgives them through his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and Mercy. Theſe Terms are equivocal, and may occaſion us to think, that the Mercy of God may be contrary to his Juſtice, that Sin may go unpuniſht, and that the Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men often make uſe of looſe and Indefinite Terms when they ſpeak of the Divine Perfections, which is not blameable ſince Philoſophical Rigour is not always neceſſary; but by a criminal Stupidity and Negligence, they abuſe theſe General Expreſſions, and draw ſo many falſe Conſequences from them, that though they all have the ſame Idea of God, and confider him as an infinitely perfect Being, yet there was ſcarcely any Imperfection that was not attributed to him in the Times of Idolatry, and Men often ſpoke of him after a very unworthy manner, for want of comparing their
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:107782:228"/>Expreſſions with the Ideas they had of him, or rather with himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis chiefly in <hi>Phiſics</hi> that theſe Looſe and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms are abuſed, which ſtir up no diſtinct Idea either of <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Manner of Being.</hi> For Inſtance: When we ſay, Bodies tend to their Center, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend by their Gravity, and aſcend by their Levity, that they move naturally, and ſucceſſively change their <hi>Forms,</hi> that they act by their <hi>Vertues, Qualities, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, &amp;c.</hi> Such Terms ſignifie nothing, and all theſe Propoſitions are abſolutely falſe in the ſenſe that moſt Philoſophers take them. There is no Center in the Senſe commonly meant, Gravity, Form, Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtir up no Idea, either of Being, or Manner of Being; they are looſe impertinent Terms which wiſe Men ſhould avoid. <hi>The Knowledge of Fools is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Talk,</hi> ſays the Scripture: Theſe Terms are only proper to cover the Ignorance of the falſely Learned, and to make the Stupid, and Libertine, believe that God only is not the True Cauſe of all Things.</p>
                  <p>This methinks is certain and eaſily conceived, yet moſt Men ſpeak freely without being at the trouble to examine whether the Terms they uſe have a clear and exact ſignification: And there are many Volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Authours, in whom it is very difficult to find a Paſſage where they underſtood what they wrote. Thoſe therefore who read much, and reſpectively hearken to the Looſe and General Diſcourſes of the falſely Learned, are groſly ignorant; nor do I ſee any way for them to grow wiſer, but by making and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly renewing their Reſolution of believing no Man upon his Word, and before they have joined very diſtinct Ideas to the moſt common Terms which others uſe. For theſe Terms are not clear as is generally thought, but only ſeem ſo through Cuſtome; for Men fancy they underſtand well what they ſay and hear, when they ſay and hear the ſame Thing a hundred times over without ever examining it.</p>

                  <head>AN EXPLANATION OF THE Concluſion of the Three Firſt BOOKS.</head>
                  <head type="sub">That Phyſicians and Spiritual Guides are abſolutely neceſſary for us, but that it's dangerous to conſult and follow them on many Occaſions.</head>
                  <p>CErtainly Man before his Fall, had all things that were neceſſary to keep his Mind and Body in a perfect State; he needed neither Phyſician nor Guide, but conſulted inward Truth as the infallible Rule of his Duty, and his Senſes were ſo faithful that they never deceived him in the uſe he was to make of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bodies for the preſervation of his own.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the Fall all things are extreamly changed; we conſult our own Paſſions much more than the Eternal Law or Truth; and our Senſes are ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that by following them we ſometimes loſe our Health and Life. Divines and Phyſicians are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, and thoſe who pretend to know beſt how to govern themſelves upon all occaſions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fall into the groſſeſt Errors, which too late teaches them that they follow a Maſter that is not over-wiſe.</p>
                  <pb n="751" facs="tcp:107782:229"/>
                  <p>However I think I may ſay, it has not ſo diſordered all the Faculties of the Soul but that we may conſult our ſelves on many occaſions; and it often happens, through the defect of it, that we loſe the Life of our Soul and Body: Of the former, by conſulting Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts that are ignorant in Religion and Morality, and who do not ſo throughly examine the Conſciences as to diſcover the ingagements and diſpoſitions of thoſe that conſult them: Of the latter, by applying our ſelves to ignorant Phyſicians, and ſuch as are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Conſtitution of our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid as a Concluſion to the three firſt Books of the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> has occaſioned ſome Perſons to imagine that I pretended, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Life and Health we ought to follow our Senſes and Paſſions in all things; and that to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in our Duty, it was needleſs to conſult any one, ſince Eternal Wiſdom is our Maſter, who ſpeaks clearly to us in the moſt ſecret parts of our Reaſon. And though I never ſaid nor thought that Phyſicians and Guides were uſeleſs, yet ſome Perſons that are haſty at judging and concluding, believe it was my Opinion, becauſe perhaps 'twas theirs; and becauſe they don't ſo much conſider Man as he is now, as what he was before the Fall: But to explain my ſelf further upon this Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Man may be conſidered two wayes, in Health and Sickneſs: If in the firſt, I think his Senſes are much more uſeful to preſerve it, than the Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the ableſt Phyſicians. There's no need of conſulting the Phyſician to know how much a Man muſt weigh; whether Wood and Stones are proper Food; whether he may throw himſelf down a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice: His Senſes teach him after a moſt ſhort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable way what he ought to do upon the like occaſions. And this methinks is ſufficient to juſtifie what I have ſaid for a Concluſion to the three firſt Books.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis not enough to juſtifie what I think, and even what I have ſaid elſewhere, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>That our Senſes admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well diſcharge their Duty, and conduct us after ſo
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:107782:230"/>juſt and faithful a manner, to the ends they were deſigned for, that they ſeem to be injuriouſly charged with Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Irregularity.</hi> For I alwayes believed that ſuch a juſtneſs, exactneſs and admirable Order, as is in our Senſations with reference to the preſervation of Life, was no effect of Sin, but the firſt inſtitution of Nature.</p>
                  <p>'Tis Objected that this Order is now much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and that if we follow our Senſes we ſhould not only eat Poyſon, but frequently eat more than we could digeſt.</p>
                  <p>But I think our Senſes would never tempt us to eat Poyſon; and that if by chance our Eyes ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to taſte it, we ſhould not find in it that reliſh as would prevail with us to ſwallow it, ſuppoſing the Poyſon was not diſguiſed: For there's much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Poyſon as Naturally produced, and poyſon'd Food; between crude Pepper, and pepper'd Meats. I confeſs our Senſes incline us to eat poyſon'd Meat, but they don't tempt us to eat Poyſon, perhaps not to taſte it, provided this Poyſon be in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God produced it; for our Senſes reach only to the Natural Order of things as at firſt eſtabliſhed by God.</p>
                  <p>I grant alſo that at preſent our Senſes tempt us to eat certain Meats to exceſs, but 'tis becauſe they are not in their Natural State. We ſhould perhaps never overcharge our ſelves with Corn, if we ground it with Teeth given us for this end; but 'tis grounded, ſifted, kneaded and baked, and even ſometimes with Milk, Butter and Sugar; it is alſo eaten with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and <hi>Ragoos</hi> of ſeveral ſorts, which provoke the Appetite; ſo that we muſt not be ſurprized if our Senſes tempt us to exceſs, when Reaſon and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence joyn to ſurprize them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the ſame in reſpect of Fleſh, which the Senſes abhor when Raw and full of Blood, as is ſeen in an Animal that dyes of it ſelf; but Men have thought upon killing Beaſts, letting out their Blood, boiling the Fleſh, ſeaſoning and diſguiſing it, and after this accuſe their Senſes of Corruption and Diſorder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:107782:230"/>they have uſed their Reaſon to prepare other ſorts of Diet than Nature ſupplies; indeed I confeſs it neceſſary that Men ſhould make uſe of the ſame Reaſon to moderate their Eating. And if Cooks have found out the art of making us eat old Shooes in a <hi>Ragoo,</hi> we ought to uſe our Reaſon, and diſtruſt theſe adulterated Meats, which are not ſuch as God made them; for he gave us our Senſes only in relation to the Order of Natural Things.</p>
                  <p>We muſt alſo obſerve that our Imagination and Senſes are miſtruſtful when we take unuſual Food. For if a Man had never eaten, nor ſeen any one eat of a certain Fruit which he had met with, he would at firſt have ſome averſion and ſenſe of fear in taſting it; his Imagination and Senſes would naturally be very attentive to the reliſh he taſted: Though never ſo hungry he would eat but little the firſt time; and if this Fruit had any dangerous quality, it would not fail to excite ſome ſurprize in him. Thus his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine is diſpoſed after ſuch a manner that he would decline it another time, and the averſion which he had for it ſenſibly diſcovering it ſelf in his looks, would deter others from eating it. All this would or might be performed in him without the aſſiſtance of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for I ſpeak not here of thoſe ſupplies which Reaſon and Inſtruction may afford. But ſeeing our Friends take bad Nouriſhments we do the ſame, for we live by Opinion, and Example emboldens us. We examine not the effect theſe Nouriſhments produce in us, and we are not afraid to eat to exceſs: Thus our Senſes do not ſo much ſhare in the Intemperance as is believed.</p>
                  <p>It is true, there are poſſibly ſuch Fruits whoſe reliſh may impoſe upon us, though we are never ſo attentive to the admonition of our Senſes, but this is certainly very rare; and we muſt not conclude from particular Inſtances that our Senſes are corrupt, and commonly deceive us in reference to the good of the Body; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they deceive becauſe we have altered our Organ by Unnatural Nouriſhment. 'Tis certain, that high-ſeaſoned Diſhes which we feed on, do by their too pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:107782:231"/>Particles hurt the Fibres of our Tongue, and vitiate its delicateneſs and diſcernment. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuch as reliſh only <hi>Ragoos,</hi> is a proof of this; for if we find no ſavour in Corn and Raw Fleſh, it is becauſe our Tongue is become inſenſible of their parts, their motions being moderate.</p>
                  <p>But though we ſuppoſe there are Fruits whoſe taſte is capable of beguiling the moſt delicate Senſes, and which are yet in their Natural Perfection, we muſt not believe that this is the effect of Sin, but becauſe 'tis impoſſible that the Senſation of Taſte which is formed and perfected according to the moſt ſimple Laws of Nature, ſhould have ſufficient diſcernment for all ſorts of Meats: Beſides the defect of this Senſe would not be remedileſs; becauſe when Mothers have an averſion for dangerous Fruits, they communicate it to their Children, not only in the Womb, but much more when born into the World; for Children only eat what is given them by their Mothers, who Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinally, and by the Air of their Countenance, impreſs upon them that horrour which they themſelves have for Fruits that are dangerous to be eaten. So that God has ſufficiently provided by our Senſes for the preſervation of Life, and nothing can be better order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For as Order requires that the Laws of the Union of our Soul and Body ſhould be very ſimple, they muſt be very general; and God ought not to eſtabliſh particular Laws for caſes that happen very ſeldom; Reaſon on ſuch occaſions muſt aſſiſt the Senſes; for Reaſon is uſeful in all things. But the Senſes are determined by ſome Natural Judgments, which are more uſeful than can be conceived, as I have proved in the Firſt Book, yet even theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſometimes Erroneous; for 'tis impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe, without multiplying the moſt ſimple Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider Man as he is now in a State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, we muſt grant that his Senſes often deceive him, even in things that relate to the Preſervation of Life; for the Oeconomy of his Machine being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, it is impoſſible but in proportion to that trouble
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:107782:231"/>there ſhould be many irregular Motions excited in his Brain; however his Senſes are not ſo corrupted as is ordinarily believed; and God has ſo wiſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the Preſervation of Life by the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, which although they are very ſimple are often ſufficient to reſtore our Health; that it is a much ſurer way to follow them, than to uſe our Reaſon or ſuch Phyſicians, who do not carefully ſtudy the Diſpoſition of their Patients; for even as a Wound cloſes up and heals of it ſelf when conſtantly cleanſed and licked, as is ſeen in wounded Animals, ſo common Diſtempers are ſoon diſperſed when we let them alone, and preciſely obſerve ſuch a ſtate of Life as theſe Diſeaſes, by a kind of Inſtinct and Senſation, dictate to us.</p>
                  <p>A Man for Example, who has a Feaver, finds that Wine is bitter and offenſive to him in that condition; yet this ſame perſon finds it agreeable and good when in Health. It even often happens that Wine is very good for the Sick when they reliſh it, provided this reliſh is not an effect of ſome previous Habit of Drinking, but that their deſire of it proceed from the preſent Diſpoſition of their Body. So that we cannot doubt but that we ought to conſult our Senſes in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what way we ſhould take for the recovery of our Health. And this is what I believe we ought to do.</p>
                  <p>The Diſtempered ſhould be extreamly attentive to certain ſecret Deſires which the actual Diſpoſition of their Body does ſometimes excite in them; but above all, to take heed leſt theſe Deſires ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome preceding Habit; they muſt let looſe their Imagination, and think on nothing that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it; obſerve their preſent Inclination, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether; it is the effect of their Diſpoſition: This done, they ought to follow it, but with much Caution; for 'tis extreamly, difficult to be aſſured whether theſe ſecret Inclinations proceed from the Diſpoſition of their Body, and it is ſometimes uſeful to conſult ſome Experienced Perſon upon it. But if the Sick, letting looſe his Imagination, as I have ſaid,
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:107782:232"/>find nothing preſented to his Mind, he muſt reſt and keep to a ſick Diet; for this will probably excite in him ſome Deſire, or diſſipate the Humours that cauſe the Sickneſs: For if the Diſtemper is increaſed not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch a ſtrict Diet and Reſt, that it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have recourſe to Experience and Phyſicians, he muſt then exactly tell every thing to ſome skilful Phyſician, who if poſſible, knows his Conſtitution; he muſt explain clearly to him the beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Diſtemper, and the condition he was in before he fell ſick, thereby to conſult the Experience and Reaſon of his Phyſician; and though the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſhould preſcribe bitter Medicines, and which indeed are kinds of Poyſon, yet they muſt be taken; for 'tis experienced that theſe Poyſons ſtay not in the Body, but drive out with them thoſe ill Humours that are the Cauſe of the Diſtemper. Here it is that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or rather Experience, muſt command the Senſes, provided the horrour of the preſented Medicine is not new; for if this horrour was as old as the Diſeaſe, 'tis a ſign the Medicine is of the ſame Nature as the ill Humours that cauſed the Diſtemper, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it would only exaſperate it.</p>
                  <p>However I believe, that before we take ſtrong Medicines, to which we are averſe, we ought to begin with ſuch as are more gentle and natural; as by drinking much Water, or taking an eaſie Vomit if the Appetite is loſt; and if we have much difficulty to vomit, Water may attenuate the over-thick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and facilitate the Circulation of the Blood in all the parts of the Body. Vomits cleanſe the Blood, and hinder the received Nouriſhment from any longer corrupting and feeding the intermitting Feavers. But I muſt no further inſiſt upon theſe things. I believe that we ought to follow the Counſel of Wiſe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who are not over-haſty, nor rely too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Medicines, nor too quick in preſcribing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; for when one is ſick, for one Medicine that does good there are always many that do hurt. The Sick are impatient; and as 'tis not for the Honour of Phyſicians, or the Profit of Apothecaries, to viſit the
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:107782:232"/>Sick without preſcribing to them, ſo alſo Phyſicians viſit too ſeldom and preſcribe too often; therefore when one is ſick, he ſhould pray his Phiſician to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard nothing, but to follow Nature, and fortifie it as much as he can; he ſhould acquaint him, that he has more Reaſon and Patience than to take it ill that he is often viſited without Relief; for on theſe Occaſions he ſometimes does a great deal who does no hurt.</p>
                  <p>I believe then, we ſhould conſult Phyſicians, and not refuſe to obey them if we would be well; for though they cannot aſſure us a Recovery, yet they may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contribute much to it, by reaſon of the repeated Experiments they make upon different Diſtempers. They know little of any thing certainly, yet they know more than we; and if they take the pains to know our Conſtitutions, carefully obſerve all the Accidents of the Diſtemper, and have much regard to our own Senſations, we may expect from them all the Aſſiſtance that we can reaſonably hope from Men.</p>
                  <p>What we have ſaid of Phiſicians may be alſo ſaid of Divines; it is abſolutely neceſſary to conſult them on ſome occaſions, and it is commonly profitable: But it often happens that it is very unprofitable, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very dangerous to conſult them. For Inſtance:</p>
                  <p>'Tis commonly ſaid, That Humane Reaſon is ſubject to Errour; but there is ſomething equivocal in this which we are not ſufficiently aware of; for we muſt not imagine, that the Reaſon which Man conſults is depraved, or that it ever deceives when faithfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted. I have ſaid, and ſtill repeat it, That it is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Reaſon alone which makes us reaſonable; it is ſovereign Truth which enlightens us; and it is God only who ſpeaks clearly to us, and knows how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us. We have only one True Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, the Eternal Wiſdom, and the <hi>Word</hi> of the Father, in whom are all the Treaſures of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God; and it is Impiety to ſay, that this Eternal Reaſon of which all Men par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, and through which they are only reaſonable, ſhould be ſubject to Errour, and capable of deceiving
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:107782:233"/>us: For it is not the Reaſon of Man but his Heart that deceives him; it is not his Light which hinders him from ſeeing his Darkneſs; it is not the Union he has with God that deceives him; it is not even in one Senſe that he has with his Body: It is his dependance upon his Body, or rather, it is becauſe he will deceive himſelf, becauſe he will injoy the Pleaſure of Judging before he has been at the Trouble of Examining, becauſe he will reſt before he is come to the Place of Truth. I have more exactly explained the Cauſe of our Errour in many places of the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> and here I ſuppoſe what I have there ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And now I affirm it needleſs to conſult Divines when we are aſſured that Truth ſpeaks to us; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Truth ſpeaks to us when we meet with Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Anſwers that are made to our Demands, or the Attention of our Mind. Therefore when we return into our ſelves, and in the ſilence of our Senſes and Paſſions hear a Voice ſo clear and intelligible, that it is impoſſible to doubt of it let Men think what they pleaſe, we muſt not conſider Cuſtom and ſecret Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or have too great a reſpect for their Anſwers who are called Learned. We muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to be ſeduced with an appearance of falſe Piety, nor be dejected through their Oppoſitions who know not the Spirit that animates them; but we muſt patiently ſuffer their Inſults, without condemning their Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or deſpiſing their Perſons. We muſt with ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Heart rejoice at the Light of Truth which enlightens us, and although its Anſwers condemn us, we muſt prefer them before all the Subtle Diſtinctions which the Imagination invents for the Juſtification of the Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>Every Man (for Inſtance) who knows how to examine himſelf, and to ſtill the Noiſe of his Senſes and Paſſions, clearly diſcovers that all the Motion which God puts into us ſhould be terminated upon himſelf, and that even God cannot diſpenſe with the Obligation we have of loving him in all things. It is evident, that God cannot but act for himſelf, that he cannot create or preſerve our Will to will any thing but
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:107782:233"/>him, or to will any thing beſides what he himſelf wills; for I cannot ſee how it's conceivable, that God ſhould will a Creature to have more love for what is leſs lovely, or love chiefly, or as its end, what is not moſt lovely.</p>
                  <p>I know well that Men who conſult their Paſſions inſtead of Order, can eaſily imagine, that God has no other Rule of his Wills than the ſame Wills, and that if God follows Order, 'tis ſurely from this that he has willed it, by a Will that is abſolutely free and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. There are ſome who think, there is no Order that is immutable and neceſſary by its nature, and that the Order or Wiſdom of God according to which he made all Things, although the firſt of Creatures is it ſelf a Creature made by a Free-will of God, and not begotten of his Subſtance by the neceſſity of his Being: But this Opinion, which ſhakes all the Foundations of Morality by taking away from Order and the Eternal Laws which depend upon it, their Immutability; and which overturns all the Superſtructure of the Chriſtian Religion, by deſpoyling Jeſus Chriſt, or the <hi>Word</hi> of God, of his Divinity, does not yet ſo throughly dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Mind as to hide from it this Truth that God Wills Order. Thus whether the Wills of God make Order, or ſuppoſe it, we clearly ſee when we examine our ſelves, that the God whom we worſhip cannot do that which evidently appears contrary to Order. So that Order willing our Time, or duration of Being, ſhould be for him who preſerves us; that all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Heart ſhould continually tend towards him who continually impreſſes it upon us; that all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our Soul ſhould only labour for him by vertue of whom they act. God cannot diſpenſe with the Commandment which he gave us by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law, and which he repeated by his Son in the Goſpel:<note place="margin">Mark 12.30.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe Order wills, that every righteous Perſon ſhould be happy and every Sinner unhappy, that every Action conformable to Order, and every Motion of love towards God, be recompenced; and on the contrary,
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:107782:234"/>it is evident, that every one who will be happy, muſt continually tend towards God, and with horrour reject every thing that would ſtop his Courſe, or diminiſh his Motion towards his True Good: 'Tis not neceſſary that for this he conſult a Spiritual Guide; for when God ſpeaks, Men ſhould be ſilent; and when we are abſolutely certain, that our Senſes and Paſſions have no part in the Anſwers which we hear inwardly, we muſt alwayes hearken reſpectively to theſe Anſwers and ſubmit to them.</p>
                  <p>Would we know, whether we ſhould go to a Ball or a Play? Whether we may in Conſcience ſpend a great part of the day at Gaming, or unprofitable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments? Whether certain Buſineſſes, Studies, Employments, are conformable to our Obligations? Let us enter into our Selves; let us ſilence our Paſſions and Senſes, and ſee the Light of God, if we can for his ſake do ſuch an Action. Let us interrogate him, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, to know if the Way we follow does not lead to Death, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (God being eſſentially Juſt, and neceſſarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to puniſh every Thing that is contrary to Order, and to recompence every Thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable thereto) we have reaſon to believe we go to encreaſe or aſſure our felicity by the Action we are about.</p>
                  <p>If it be our Love to God that carries us to the Ball, let us go thither; if we ſhould play to gain Heaven, let us play Day and Night; if we have in ſight the Glory of God in our Employ, let us encreaſe it, let us do all Things with Joy; for our Recompence will be great in Heaven: But if after having carefully examined our Eſſential Obligations, we diſcover clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That neither our Being nor duration are of us, that we do an Injuſtice which God cannot but puniſh, when we endeavour to ſpend our Time in vain: If our Maſter and Lord, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who has purchaſed us by his Blood, reproaches our Infidelity and Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, after a very clear and intelligible manner, for living after the Fleſh and the World, for leading a Soft and Voluptuous Life, and for following Opinion
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:107782:234"/>and Cuſtom; let us obey his voice, and not harden our Hearts; let us not ſeek for <hi>Guides</hi> that ſoften theſe Reproaches, embolden us againſt theſe Menaces, and who obſcure this Light, with agreeable Clouds which hurt and penetrate our very Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the ditch,</hi> ſayes the Goſpel; but if the Blind Man, who ſuffers himſelf to be lead, fall with him that leads him, if God does hot excuſe him, will he excuſe him who ſees clearly, and yet ſuffers himſelf to be lead by the Blind, becauſe this Blind Perſon leads him agreeably, and entertains him in the way according to his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? Theſe voluntary Blind ought to know, that God who never deceives, does ſometimes permit theſe Seducers to puniſh corrupted Hearts who ſeek Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; that Blindneſs is a puniſhment of Sin, although 'tis often the Cauſe thereof; and that 'tis juſt, that he who would not hearken to Eternal Wiſdom, which only ſpeaks to him for his good, ſhould leave him at length to be corrupted by Men, who deceive ſo much the more dangerouſly, as they flatter him more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
                  <p>It is true, 'tis difficult to enter into ones ſelf, to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ones Senſes and Paſſions, and to diſcern whether 'tis God or our Body who ſpeaks to us; for we often take the Proofs of Senſation for evident Reaſons, and then 'tis neceſſary to conſult Guides; but 'tis not alwayes neceſſary to conſult them: For we ſee our Duty on many occaſions with the utmoſt evidence and certainty, and then it is even dangerous to conſult them, if it be not done with an entire Sincerity, and a Spirit of Humility and Obedience; for theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions oblige God not to permit us to be deceived, or at leaſt in no very dangerous manner.</p>
                  <p>When 'tis neceſſary to conſult a Guide, we muſt chooſe one who underſtands Religion, who reverences the Goſpel, and who knows Man. We muſt take care that the Converſe of the World has not corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that Friendſhip has not made him too Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, ſo that he may either fear or hope any thing from us. We muſt chooſe one among a thouſand,
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:107782:235"/>ſayes St. <hi>Thereſia,</hi> who as ſhe relates of her ſelf, had like to have been loſt by the defect: of an ignorant Guide.</p>
                  <p>The World is full of Deceivers, I ſay Religious Deceivers as well as others: Thoſe who love us, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us through Complaiſance; thoſe who are below us, flatter us through Reſpect or Fear; thoſe who are above us, conſider not our Neceſſities, either through Contempt or Negligence. Beſides all Men counſel us according to the relation we give them of what paſſes in us, and we are never wanting to flatter our ſelves; for we inſenſibly cover our Sore when we are aſhamed of it. We often deceive thoſe who direct us, that we may deceive our ſelves; for we ſuppoſe our ſelves ſafe when we follow them. They guide us whither we have a mind to go, and we endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves, in ſpight of our Light and the ſecret reproaches of our Reaſon, that 'tis our Obedience which determines us. We deceive our ſelves, and God permits it; but we never deceive him who exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines our Hearts; and though we ſhut our Ears as much as we can againſt the voice of inward Truth, we ſufficiently feel by the reproaches of this ſoveraign Truth which leaves us to our ſelves, that it inlightens our darkneſs, and diſcovers all the ſubtleties of ſelf-love.</p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore evident that we muſt conſult our Reaſon for the Health of our Soul, as our Senſes for that of our Body; and when Reaſon anſwers not clearly, we muſt neceſſarily have recourſe to Guides, as we would to Phyſicians when our Senſes fail us, but this muſt be done with diſcretion; for Guides that are but a little enlightened may ſometimes deſtroy our Soul, as unexpert Phyſicians may our Body.</p>
                  <p>As I don't throughly explain the Rules which might be given in reſpect of the choice and uſe that ſhould be made of Guides and Phyſicians, I deſire my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be equitably interpreted, and that it may not be imagined that I would hinder any from ſeeking neceſſary aſſiſtance from others. I know that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Bleſſing attends our ſubmiſſion to the Opinions
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:107782:235"/>of the Wiſe and Underſtanding, and I am willing to believe this General Rule, <hi>Let us dye according to the received Laws of Phiſics,</hi> to the generality of Men, they are ſafer than any other that I could eſtabliſh for the Preſervation of Life.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe it is alwayes profitable to examine our ſelves, and conſult the Goſpel; to hearken to Jeſus Chriſt whether he ſpeaks immediately to our Mind and Heart, or by Faith declares himſelf to our Ears or Eyes, I believe I might ſay what I have ſaid; for our Guides themſelves deceive us when they ſpeak contrary to what Faith and Reaſon teach us. And as it is to give Honour to God by believing his Works, to have that which is neceſſary for their preſervation, I thought I ſhould make Men ſenſible that the Machine of their Body is contrived after ſo admirable a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that of it ſelf it diſcovers more eaſily what is neceſſary for its Preſervation, than by Science, or even the Experience of the moſt able Phyſicians.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That Love is different from Peaſure and Joy.</head>
                  <p>THE Mind commonly confounds things which are very different, when they happen at the ſame time, and are not contrary to one another: Of which I have given many Inſtances in this Work; becauſe 'tis therein that our Errors chiefly conſiſt, in reſpect to what paſſes in our ſelves. As we have no clear Idea of what conſtitutes the Nature or Eſſence of our Mind, nor of the Modifications it is capable of; it often happens that we confound things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely different, if they happen within us but at the ſame time; ſince we eaſily confound what we do not know by a clear and diſtinct Idea.</p>
                  <p>It is not only impoſſible clearly to diſcover wherein the difference of ſuch things conſiſts as paſs within us, but it is alſo difficult to diſcern whether there is any difference between them: For to effect this we muſt look into our ſelves, not to conſider what is volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily done in reference to Good and Evil, but to make an abſtracted Reflection upon our ſelves, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be performed without much Diſtraction and Pains.</p>

                  <p>We eaſily conceive that the Roundneſs of a Body, is different from its Motion: And although we know by Experience, that a Bowl upon a Plane cannot be puſhed without being moved; and then Roundneſs and Motion are found together; however we don't confound them one with the other, becauſe we know both Motion and Figure by very diſtinct and clear Ideas: But 'tis not ſo with Pleaſure and Love, for we commonly confound them. Our Mind, if we may ſo ſay, becomes movable by Pleaſure, as a Ball does by its Roundneſs; and becauſe it is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an impreſſion towards good, it is immediately put in motion towards the Object which cauſes, or ſeems to cauſe this Pleaſure: So that this motion of Love happening to the Soul at the ſame time it feels this Pleaſure, it is enough to make it confound its Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with its Love, becauſe it has not ſo clear an Idea either of its Pleaſure or its Love, as it has of Figure and Motion. Wherefore ſome Perſons will believe that Pleaſure and Love are not different, and that I diſtinguiſh too many things in each of our Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>But to make it plainly appear that Pleaſure and Love are very different, I ſhall diſtinguiſh two ſorts of Pleaſures, one of which precedes Reaſon, as agreeable Senſations, which we commonly call Pleaſures of the Body; and the other ſort neither precede Reaſon nor the Senſes, and are generally called the Pleaſures of the Soul: Such as Joy which is excited in us in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a clear Knowledge, or a confuſed Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we have, that ſome good is, or will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance: A Man taſting of a Fruit which he knows not, finds ſome Pleaſure in eating it, if this Fruit be good for his Nouriſhment. This is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Pleaſure; for ſince he feels it before he knows whether this Fruit is good or nor, it is evident that this Pleaſure prevents his Reaſon. An Huntſman when hungry, expecting or actually finding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat, actually feels Joy: Now this Joy is a Pleaſure which follows the knowledge he has of his preſent or future good.</p>
                  <pb n="766" facs="tcp:107782:237"/>
                  <p>It is perhaps evident by this diſtinction of Pleaſure into that which follows and precedes Reaſon, that there is neither of them but differs from Love: For that Pleaſure which precedes Reaſon, certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes Love; ſince it precedes all knowledge, which in ſome degree or other is always ſuppoſed by Love. And on the contrary, Joy or Pleaſure which ſuppoſes Knowledge, alſo ſuppoſes Love; ſince Joy ſuppoſes the confuſed Senſation, or clear Knowledge that we do, or ſhall poſſeſs what we love; and if we poſſeſſed a thing we had no love for, we ſhould receive no Joy by it. Thus Pleaſure is very different from Love; ſince the Pleaſure which precedes Reaſon, precedes and cauſes Love; and the Pleaſure which follows Reaſon, neceſſarily ſuppoſes Love, as an Effect ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, if Pleaſure and Love were the ſame thing, there would never be Pleaſure without Love, nor Love without Pleaſure; for a thing cannot be without it ſelf. Yet a Chriſtian loves his Enemy, and a Child well educated, loves his Father, how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and unkind ſoever he may be. The ſight of their Duty, the fear of God, and love of Order and Juſtice, makes them love not only without Pleaſure, but even with a kind of Horrour, ſuch Perſons as are not agreeable to them. I confeſs they ſometimes feel Pleaſure or Joy, when they think they do their Duty; or when they hope to be recompenſed according to their Merit: But beſides that, this Pleaſure viſibly differs very much from the Love they have to their Father or Enemy, although it be perhaps the Motive of it; it often happens that 'tis not even this Motive which makes them act; it is ſometimes only an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted view of Order, or notion of Fear, which preſerves their Love. We may even in one ſenſe ſay they have a Love for theſe Perſons at the time they think not of them: For Love remains in us during the diverſions of our thoughts, and whilſt we ſleep; but Pleaſure ſeems to me to ſubſiſt no longer in the Soul, than whilſt it is ſenſible of it. Thus Love or Charity remaining in us without Pleaſure or Delight,
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:107782:237"/>it cannot be maintained that Pleaſure and Love is the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>As Pleaſure and Pain are two direct contraries: If Pleaſure were the ſame thing with Love, Pain would not differ from Hatred. Now it is evident that Pain is different from Hatred, ſince Pain often ſubſiſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hatred. A Man, for inſtance, who is hurt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving it, ſuffers a real and cutting Pain, but is free from Hatred; for he does not ſo much as know the Cauſe of his Pain, or Object of his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; or rather, the Cauſe of his Pain not being wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Hatred, it cannot excite it in him. Thus he hates not this Cauſe of his Pain, although his Pain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines him to, or diſpoſes him to hate it. It is true this Man hates his Pain, for Pain deſerves Hatred; but the hatred of Pain is not Pain, but only ſuppoſes it. The hatred of Pain is not worthy of Hatred as Pain: On the contrary 'tis very agreeable; for we pleaſe our ſelves in hating Pain, as we are diſpleaſed in ſuffering it. Pain therefore is not Hatred; nor is Pleaſure, which is oppoſite to Pain, Love; which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Hatred: Conſequently the Pleaſure which precedes Reaſon, is not the ſame thing as Love. And I likewiſe prove, that the Joy or Pleaſure which follows Reaſon is alſo diſtinct from Love.</p>
                  <p>As Joy and Sorrow are directly oppoſite: If Joy was the ſame thing as Love, Sorrow would not differ from Hatred: But it is plain that Sorrow is different from Hatred; for Sorrow ſometimes ſubſiſts without Hatred. For inſtance: A Man finds himſelf by chance deprived of ſuch things as he has need of: This is enough to cauſe Sorrow, but it cannot excite Hatred in him; either becauſe he knows not the Cauſe which deprived him of theſe neceſſaries, or elſe that this Cauſe not being worthy of his Hatred, it could not ſtir it up in him. It is true this Man hates the privation or the good that he loves; but it is plain that this kind of Hatred is properly Love: For he hates the privation of good, only becauſe he loves the good: And ſince to fly the privation of good, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards good; it is evident that the motion of
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:107782:238"/>this Mans Hatred differs not from that of his Love.</p>
                  <p>Thus his Hatred, if he's poſſeſt of any, not being contrary to his Love, and Sorrow being always oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Joy, it is plain that his Sorrow is not his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; conſequently Joy differs from Love. In fine, it is manifeſt when we are ſorrowful, 'tis becauſe of the preſence of ſomething we hate, or rather the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſomething we love. Thus Sorrow ſuppoſes Hatred, or rather Love, but is very different from both theſe things.</p>
                  <p>I very well know St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirms, that Pain is an a verſion which the Soul conceives, becauſe the Body is not diſpoſed after ſuch a manner as it wiſhes; and that he often confounds Delectation with Charity, Pleaſure with Joy, Pain with Sorrow, Pleaſure and Joy with Love, Pain and Sorrow with Averſion or Hatred. But 'tis very probable that this Holy Doctor ſpoke all this according to the general Language amongſt the common ſort of Men, who confound the greateſt part of thoſe things which paſs within them at the ſame time: Or it may be he had not examined theſe things after a very exact and Philoſophical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. However I believe I may and ought to ſay, that it appear'd requiſite to me, exactly to diſtinguiſh theſe things, if we would clearly and without equivocation explain many Queſtions which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> has treated on: For even thoſe who have contrary Opinions amongſt themſelves, have been accuſtomed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them from the Authority of this great Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the different Senſe his Expreſſions may be taken in; which is not alwayes exact enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſuch Perſons, who perhaps have more mind to diſpute than agree.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Concerning the Efficacy attributed to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>EVer ſince the Fall, the Mind of Man is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imployed upon External Objects; he even forgets himſelf, and him who penetrates and inlightens him; and ſuffers himſelf after ſuch a manner to be ſeduced by his own and the Bodies about him, that he expects in them to find his Perfection and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He who alone is capable of acting in it, now hides himſelf from our Eyes; nor are his Operations performed after a ſenſible manner; and although he produces and preſerves all Beings, the Mind which eagerly ſeeks the Cauſe of all things, finds much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to diſcover him, although it meets with him every moment. Some Philoſophers have choſe rather to imagine a <hi>Nature</hi> and certain <hi>Faculties</hi> as the Cauſes of thoſe Effects we call Natural, than to give God all the Honour which is due to his Power. And although they have no Proof, nor ſo much as a clear Idea of this Nature and theſe Faculties, as I hope I have ſhown, they chooſe rather to ſpeak without knowing what they ſay, and to reſpect a Power purely imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:107782:239"/>than to make any endeavour to diſcover the hand of him who performs whatever is done in all things.</p>
                  <p>I cannot forbear believing that one of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable conſequences of Original Sin, is our having no more guſt nor ſenſation for God; or that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him not, or meet him but with a kind of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and fright. We ought to acknowledge God in all things; be ſenſible of his Strength and Power in all Natural Effects; admire his Wiſdom in the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Order of the Creatures; and in a word, adore, fear, and love only him in all his Works. But there is now a ſecret oppoſition between Man and God; Man finding himſelf a Sinner hides himſelf; flyes the Light; is apprehenſive of meeting God; and chooſes rather to imagine in the Bodies which are about him, a Power or blind Nature, which he can make fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to himſelf, than to meet there the terrible Power of a Holy and Juſt God, who knows and performs all things.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs there are many perſons, who by a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Principle than that of the Heathen Philoſophers, purſue their Opinion about Nature and Second Cauſes. But I hope we ſhall diſcover by the conſequence of this Diſcourſe, that they are of this Opinion only through a received prejudice, which it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to deliver themſelves from, without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that may be drawn from the Principles of a Philoſophy which has not alwayes been ſufficiently known: For it is probably this which has hindered them from declaring in favour of an Opinion, which I have thought my Duty to maintain.</p>
                  <p>There are many Reaſons which keep me from aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to Second or Natural Cauſes, a ſtrength, power, or efficacy to produce any thing whatever; but the chief is, becauſe I cannot even conceive this Opinion: What endeavours ſoever I make to comprehend it, I cannot find in my ſelf an Idea which repreſents to me, what this Strength or Power can be, which they attribute to Creatures: And I believe that I ſhould not make a raſh Judgment, if I affirm that thoſe who
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:107782:239"/>maintain that Creatures have in themſelves this Strength and Power, advance what they do not clearly conceive. For if the Heathen Philoſophers had a clear conception that Second Cauſes have a true Power to act and produce their like; being a Man as well as they, and with them partaking of the ſoveraign Reaſon, I might probably diſcover the Idea which repreſented the Power to them: but what efforts ſoever I make, I can find no Strength, Efficacy or Power, but in the Will of the infinitely perfect Being.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when I think of the different Opinions of Philoſophers upon this Subject, I cannot doubt of what I advance. For if they clearly ſaw what this Power of the Creatures is, or what there is in them that is really powerful, they would not differ in their Opinion about it. When perſons cannot agree, and having no intereſted Reaſon which hinders them from it, 'tis a certain mark they have no clear Idea of what they ſay, and that they underſtand not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: chiefly if they diſpute upon ſuch Subjects as are not complext, or difficult to be diſcuſt; like this Queſtion before us: For we ſhould find no hard matter to reſolve it, if perſons had but a clear Idea of a Created Power. Theſe are therefore ſome of their Opinions, whereby we may ſee how little they agree amongſt themſelves.</p>

<pb n="773" facs="tcp:107782:240"/>they only could penetrate them. For theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men not admitting a <hi>Void,</hi> nor the <hi>Atoms</hi> of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and the Subtil Matter of <hi>D' Cartes</hi> was unknown to them, they could not think with <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> That there were Bodies ſmall enough to enter into the Pores of thoſe which appear'd the moſt Hard and Solid.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me, that this diverſity of Opinions gives us a Right to judge, That Men often ſpoke ſuch Things as they did not underſtand; and that the Power of the Creatures being a pure Fiction of the Mind, of which we have no Natural Idea, each Perſon imagined it what he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>It is true, in all Ages this Power was acknowledged as Real and True by moſt Men: But it is as certain, it was without any Proof; I do not ſay Demonſtration; but even without ſuch a Proof as was able to make any impreſſion upon an Attentive Mind. For the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Arguments which are maintained only upon the deceitful Teſtimony of the Senſes and Imagination, ought not to be received by thoſe who make uſe of their Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſpeaking of what they call <hi>Nature,</hi> ſayes, It is ridiculous to endeavour to prove, That Natural Bodies have an Inward Principle of their own <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Reſt:</hi> Becauſe, ſayes he, it is ſelf-evident. He doubts not alſo, but a Bowl which hits another, has power to put it in motion. It appears ſo to the Eyes, and that's enough for him; for he commonly follows the Teſtimony of the Senſes, and rarely that of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, never troubling himſelf whether it be intelligible or not.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who oppoſe the Opinion of ſome Divines that have writ againſt Second Cauſes, ſay with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That the Senſes convince us of their Efficacy: This is their Firſt and Principal Proof. It is evident, ſay they,<note place="margin">See <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeca Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio, Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> and the rest already cited.</note> that Fire burns, the Sun ſhines, Water cools, and he muſt be a Fool that doubts it. The Authours of the contrary Opinion, ſays the Great <hi>Averrors,</hi> had their, Brains diſturbed. We muſt (ſay almoſt all the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetics) uſe Senſible Proofs to convince <hi>thoſe</hi> who
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:107782:241"/>deny this Efficacy, and ſo oblige them to confeſs, They may be moved and hurt by Second Cauſes: It is the Judgment which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has already pronounced againſt <hi>them,</hi> and it ought to be executed.</p>
                  <p>But this pretended Demonſtration cannot but produce pitty,<note place="margin">L. of his <hi>Topi.</hi> ch. 1.</note> ſince it diſcovers the Weakneſs of the Humane Mind, and that even Philoſophers themſelves are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more Senſible than Rational. It diſcovers, that thoſe who glory in the Enquiry after Truth, do not themſelves know who they ought to conſult to learn any thing of it: Whether 'tis the Soveraign Reaſon which never deceives them, but always ſpeaks Things as they are in themſelves; or the Body which ſpeaks only out of intereſt, and in relation either to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or conveniency of Life. For in fine, What Prejudices will not be juſtified if we take the Senſes for Judges, to whom almoſt all Prejudices owe their birth? As I have already ſhewn in the <hi>Search after Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I ſee one Bowle hit another, my Eyes tell me, or ſeem to tell me, that it is truly the Cauſe of the Motion it impreſſes: For the true Cauſe which moves Bodies does not appear to my Eyes. Bur when I ask my Reaſon, I ſee evidently that Bodies cannot move themſelves, and their Moving power depending only upon the Will of God, which ſucceſſively pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them in different places, they cannot communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a power which they have not, nor could commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate if they had it. For 'tis plain, there is a Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom requiſite, and one that is infinite too to regulate the Communication of Motions with the exactneſs, proportion, and uniformity that we ſee. A Body moved cannot know the infinite number of Bodies it meets at every moment: It is farther clear, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſhould even ſuppoſe knowledge in it, it could not have enough to regulate, in the inſtant of the Shock, the diſtribution of the Moving power it ſelf is carried with.</p>
                  <p>If I open but my Eyes, it appears plain to me that the Sun is very gloriouſly bright, and ſeems not only to be viſible it ſelf, but makes all the World ſo too:
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:107782:241"/>'Tis that which covers the Earth with Flowers and Fruits, which gives Life to Animals, and which by its Heat penetrates into the very Bowels of the Earth, and produces Stones, Marbles, and Metals there. But when I conſult Reaſon, I ſee nothing of all this; and if I conſult it faithfully, I clearly diſcover that my Senſes ſeduce me, and that it is God who performs all in all Things. For knowing, that whatever changes happen in the Body, they have no other principle but the different communication of Motion, which occur in viſible or inviſible Bodies; I ſee that it is God who does all Things, ſince it is his Will which Cauſes, and his Wiſdom which Regulates all theſe Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe that Local Motion is the principle of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, Corruptions, Alterations, and generally of all the Changes which happen in the Body; which is an Opinion that is now ſufficiently received amongſt the Learned. But whatever Opinion they have about it ſignifies little; for it ſeems much more eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that a Body drives another when it meets it, than to apprehend, how Fire produces Heat and Light, and draw from the power of Matter a Subſtance which was not there before. And if it be neceſſary to acknowledge, That God is the True Cauſe of the different Communications of Motions, by a much ſtronger Reaſon we ought to conclude, That none but he can Create, and Annihilate, Real Qualities, and Subſtantial Forms. I ſay, Create, and Annihilate, becauſe at leaſt it ſeems as difficult to me, to draw from Matter a Subſtance which was not in it, or to cauſe it to re-enter again, as to Create or Annihilate it. But I ſhall not ſtand upon Terms; I only make uſe of them becauſe there is no other, which I know of, that clearly, and without Equivocation, expreſs the Changes which the Philoſophers ſuppoſe every Moment to happen through the power of Second Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>I had ſome difficulty here, to relate the other Proofs which they commonly give for the Power and Efficacy of Natural Cauſes; for they appear ſo weak to thoſe
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:107782:242"/>who are able to reſiſt Prejudices, and prefer their Reaſon to their Senſes, that it does not ſeem likely that reaſonable Men ſhould be perſwaded by them. Yet I will produce and Anſwer them, ſince there are many Philoſophers who make uſe of them.</p>

They would alwayes ſee Animals perform Certain Actions, as Eating, Growing, Crying, Running, Leaping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor would they obſerve any thing like this in Stones: And it is this only which makes the common Philoſophers believe, that Beaſts live, and Stones do not; for it muſt not be imagined, that they know by a clear and diſtinct View of the Mind what the Life of a Dog is. It is their Senſes which regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Deciſions upon this Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>If it were neceſſary, I could here prove, That the Principal of a Dog's Life differs very little, if at all, from that of the Motion of a Watch. For the Life of Bodies, whatever they be, can only conſiſt in the motion of their parts; and it is not difficult to judge, that the ſame Subtil Matter which in a Dog cauſes the Fermentation of the Blood and Animal Spirits, and is the principle of his Life, is not more perfect than that which gives Motion to the Springs of a Watch, or cauſes Gravitation in the Weights of a Clock, which is the principle of their Life, or (to ſpeak as others do) of their Motion.</p>

                     <p>We could not diſcover the Differences nor Powers of the Elements: So that Fire might cool as Water does; and the Nature of nothing would be ſettled and fixed.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, That Nature continuing as it is; that is, whilſt the Laws of the communication of Motions remain conſtantly the ſame; it is a contradiction that Fire ſhould not burn; or not ſeparate the parts of certain Bodies. Fire cannot cool like Water, except it becomes Water: For Fire being only fewel, whoſe parts have been agitated with a violent Motion, by an inviſible Matter which incompaſſes them, as is eaſie to be demonſtrated; it is impoſſible theſe parts ſhould not communicate ſome of their Motion to the Bodies which they meet. Now as theſe Laws are conſtant; the Nature of Fire, its vertues and qualities cannot change. But this Nature and theſe Vertues are only conſequences of the general and efficacious Will of God, who does all in all things; as we learn from the Scripture. So that the ſtudy of Nature is falſe and vain in every reſpect, when we ſeek for any other true Cauſes than the Will of the <hi>ALMIGHTY.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I own we muſt not have recourſe to God or the Univerſal Cauſe, when we inquire into the reaſon of particular Effects. For we ſhould make our ſelves ridiculous if, for inſtance, we ſaid that 'twas God who dryes the wayes, or freezes the Water in Rivers. We muſt ſay that the Air dryes the Earth, becauſe it agitates and ſucks up the Water which is tempered
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:107782:243"/>with it. And that the Air or ſubtle Matter freezes Rivers in Winter; becauſe it does not then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate motion enough to the parts of which the Water is compoſed. In a word, we muſt if we can, give the Natural and Particular Cauſe of the Effects produced. But as the action of theſe Cauſes conſiſt only in the Moving Power which acts them, and that this Moving Power is nothing elſe but the Will of God who creates them, or ſucceſſively preſerves them in different places, we muſt not ſay that they have in themſelves a Strength or Power to produce any Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. And when in Reaſoning we are at laſt come to a general Effect whoſe Cauſe we ſeek, 'twould be a very ill way of Philoſophizing, to imagine any other beſides the general one. And to feign a <hi>Certain Nature,</hi> a <hi>Firſt Moveable,</hi> an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Soul,</hi> or ſome ſuch like <hi>Chimera,</hi> of which we have no clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Idea, would be to argue like the Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. For inſtance: When we are ask't whence it comes that ſome Bodies are in Motion; or how the Air when agitated communicates its Motion to the Water; or rather from whence it proceeds that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies impell one another: As Motion and its commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is a general Effect whereupon all others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; it is neceſſary, I dont ſay to be a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but to be a Philoſopher, to recur to God who is the Univerſal Cauſe; ſince 'tis his Will which is the Moving Power of Bodies, and which alſo regulates the communication of their Motions. If he had Will'd there ſhould be no new production in the World, he would not have put the parts of it in Motion: And if he ſhould hereafter Will the incorruptibility of any of the Beings he has Created, he would ceaſe to Will certain communications of Motions in reſpect to theſe Beings.</p>

God never multiplies his Wills without Reaſon, but alwayes acts by the moſt ſimple wayes; and therefore he makes uſe of the meeting of Bodies in giving them Motion; not as their ſhock is abſolutely neceſſary to move them, as our Senſes tell us; but becauſe that being the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the communication of Motion, there needs only a few Natural Laws to produce all the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Effects that we ſee: For by this means we can reduce all the Laws of the communication of Motion to one only, which is, That Bodies which ſhock each other, being look'd upon but as one in the moment of their contact, or ſhock, the Moving Power is at their ſeparation, divided between them according to the proportion of their magnitude. But as concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodies are incompaſſed with an infinite number of other Bodies, which act upon them by vertue and efficacy of this Law; how conſtant and uniform ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be, it produces an infinite number of different communications, becauſe it acts upon infinite Bodies, which all relate to one another.</p>

Bodies meet, ſhock, and reſiſt one another; therefore God acts not in them, except by his concurrence: For if he only produced and preſerved Motion in Bodies, he would divert them before their meeting, ſince he knows very well that they are impenetrable. Why ſhould Bodies be impelled to be thrown back again; or made to advance that they may recoil? Or wherefore are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Motions produced and preſerved? Is it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant to ſay, that God fights againſt himſelf, and deſtroys his own works, when a Bull oppoſes a Lion, or a Wolf devours a Sheep, and a Sheep eats the Graſs which he gave growth to? Therefore there are Second Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ANSWER.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then Second Cauſes do every thing, and God does nothing at all: For God cannot act againſt himſelf; and to concur is to act. Concurring to contrary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is giving contrary concourſes, and conſequently a performing contrary actions. To concur with the action of the Creatures which reſiſt one another, is to act againſt himſelf; and to concur to uſeleſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is to act unuſefully: Now God does nothing in
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:107782:244"/>vain; he performs no actions contrary to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Therefore he concurs not in the action of the Creatures, who often deſtroy one another, and make uſeleſs actions and motions. Hither 'tis that this Proof of Second Cauſes conducts us; but let us examine what Reaſon teaches us about it.</p>
                     <p>God does all in every thing, and nothing reſiſts him. He performs all things; ſince 'tis by his Wills that all Motions are produced and regulated; and nothing reſiſts him, becauſe whatever he wills is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. And thus it ought to be conceived. He having reſolved to produce by the moſt ſimple wayes, as the moſt conformable to order, this infinite variety of Creatures that we admire, he determined Bodies to move in a right line, becauſe this line is the moſt ſimple. But Bodies being impenetrable, and their Motions inclining to oppoſite lines, or ſuch as interſect, they muſt neceſſarily meet one another, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ceaſe to move in the ſame manner. God foreſaw this; and nevertheleſs poſitively willed the meeting or oppoſition of Bodies; not becauſe he was pleaſed to fight againſt himſelf, but becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to make uſe of this ſhocking of Bodies, as an occaſion to eſtabliſh the general Law of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Motions, by which he foreſaw he might produce an infinite number of admirable Effects. For I am perſwaded that theſe two Natural Laws which are the moſt ſimple of all: <hi>Viz. That all Motion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to put it ſelf in a right Line:</hi> And <hi>That in the time of concurrence, Motions are communicated in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the magnitude of the Bodies which are ſhockt;</hi> are ſufficient to produce the World as we ſee it at this day; I mean, the Heavens, the Stars, the Planets, Comets, Earth and Water, Air and Fire. In a word, the Elements, and all inorganized or inanimate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: For organized Bodies depend upon many other Natural Laws which are wholly unknown to us. It may be alſo that animate Bodies are not formed like others, by a certain number of Natural Laws: For 'tis very probable, they were all formed at the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World; and that by time they only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:107782:245"/>that growth which was neceſſary to make them viſible to our eyes. Let it be how it will, 'tis certain they receive this growth from the general Laws of Nature, according to which all other Bodies are formed; upon which account their growth is not alwayes regular.</p>
                     <p>I ſay then, that God by the firſt Natural Law, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively will'd, and conſequently produced the Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Bodies; and that he afterwards made uſe of it as an occaſion to eſtabliſh the ſecond Natural Law, which regulates the communication of Motions; and that thus the actual ſhock is a Natural or Occaſional Cauſe of the actual communication of Motions.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider this well, it will be viſibly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that nothing could be better ordered. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing God had not ordained it thus; and that he had diverted Bodies when ready to hit each other, as if there were a <hi>void</hi> to receive them. Firſt, Bodies would not then have been ſubject to this continual viciſſitude, which cauſes the Beauty of the Univerſe; for the generation of certain Bodies, is only produced by the corruption of ſome others: and 'tis the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of their Motions which produces their variety. Nor Secondly, Would God then act by the moſt ſimple wayes: For that Bodies ready to ſhock each other, might continue their Motion without ſtriking, it would be neceſſary that they ſhould variouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe an infinite number of Curve-Lines; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we muſt admit different Wills in God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their Motions. Laſtly, If there was no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the action of Natural Bodies, and if their Motion was not performed in a right Line, there would be no certain Principle for us to Reaſon upon in Natural Philoſophy, nor to guide us in many Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Lives.</p>
                     <p>'Tis no diſorder for Lyons to eat Wolves; Wolves, Sheep; and Sheep, the Graſs which God has taken ſo much care of, that he has given it all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its own preſervation, and alſo a Seed to preſerve its Kind. Yet this proves Second Cauſes no more, than the Plurality of Cauſes, or contrary Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:107782:245"/>of Good and Evil, which the <hi>Manichees</hi> invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give a Reaſon for theſe Effects. But 'tis a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mark of the Wiſdom, Greatneſs, and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of God; for he does nothing unbecoming an Infinite Wiſdom, and performs all things with ſuch a Munificence as ſufficiently ſhows his Power and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Whatever is deſtroy'd is again repair'd by the ſame Law which deſtroy'd it; ſo great is the Wiſdom, Power, and Fruitfulneſs of this Law. God does not prevent the deſtruction of Beings by a New Will; not only becauſe the firſt is ſufficient to repair them, but chiefly becauſe his Wills are much more valuable than the reparation of theſe Beings. They are of much more value than all they produce. And if God made this viſible World, although in it ſelf unworthy of the action whereby it was produced, 'twas for ends unknown to Philoſophers, and to Honour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> with ſuch an Honour as the Creatures are uncapable of giving him.</p>
                     <p>When a Houſe by its fall cruſhes a good Man to death, a greater Evil happens than when one Beaſt devours another; or when one Body is forced to give way by the ſhock it receives at the meeting of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But God multiplies not his Wills to redreſs ſuch diſorders, real or apparent, as are neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Natural Laws: He ought neither to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect nor change theſe Laws, although they ſhould ſometimes produce Monſters. He muſt not confound the order and ſimplicity of his wayes. He ought to neglect inconſiderable things: I mean, he ſhould not have particular Wills to produce Effects of no value, or unworthy the action of him who produces them. God works Miracles only when the Order he always follows requires it; and this Order wills that he ſhould act by the moſt ſimple wayes; and that there ſhould be no exceptions in his Wills, but when 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to his deſigns; or on certain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions which are wholly unknown to us. For although we are all united to the Order or Wiſdom of God, we know not all the Rules of it. We ſee in it what we ought to do; but comprehend not by
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:107782:246"/>it what God ought to Will, nor muſt we be too ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about it.</p>
                     <p>We have a great inſtance of what I have been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the damnation of an infinite number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that God has permitted to periſh in times of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. God is infinitely good; loves all his works; would have all Men be ſaved, and come to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth; for he has Created them to injoy him: And yet the greateſt number are damn'd. They live and dye in blindneſs, and will continue in it to all Eternity. And does not this proceed from Gods act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the moſt ſimple wayes, and from his following Order? We have ſhown that according to Order, God ought not by preingaging Pleaſures to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Will of the Firſt Man; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Fall cauſed the diſorder of Nature.<note place="margin">See the Explanation of the fourth Chapter of the Second Part: <hi>Of Method.</hi>
                        </note> It was requiſite that all Men ſhould deſcend from one; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is the moſt ſimple way, but for Reaſons too Theological and abſtracted to be here explained.<note place="margin">See alſo the Firſt Explanation of the Fifth Chapter.</note> In fine, We ought to believe that this is conformable to the Order which God follows, and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he alwayes conſults in the intention and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his deſigns. The Sin of the firſt Man has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an infinite number of Evils, 'tis true; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Order required that God ſhould permit it, and that he ſhould place Man in an eſtate wherein he was capable of ſinning.</p>
                     <p>God is willing to repair his work; but rarely gives thoſe victorious Graces which conquers the Malice of the greateſt Sinners. He often gives Graces that are uſeleſs to the Converſion of thoſe who receive them; although in reſpect to them he foreſees their unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs, he ſometimes beſtows them in great number, which nevertheleſs produces but little Effect. Why all theſe <hi>Ambages</hi> and indirect wayes? Would it not have been ſufficient for him to have will'd the Converſion of a Sinner, to have effected it after an efficacious and invincible manner? Is it not plain that 'tis becauſe he acts by the moſt ſimple wayes, and
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:107782:246"/>that Order requires it, although we do not alwayes ſee it. For God can only act according to Order and Wiſdom, although his Order and Wiſdom are often impenetrable abyſſes to the Mind of Man. There are certain very ſimple Laws in the Order of Grace; conſonant to which God commonly acts: For this Order has its Rules as well as that of Narure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we know them not; as we ſee in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Motions. Let us only follow the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel given us in the Holy Goſpel, by him who perfectly knew the Laws of Grace.</p>
                     <p>I ſay this to quiet the unjuſt Complaints of Sinners, who deſpiſe the Advice given them by <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> and who charge God with their Malice and Diſorders. They would have him to perform Miracles in their Favour; and diſpence with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws of Grace. They live in Pleaſure, ſeek after Honour, and continually renew thoſe Wounds which ſenſible Objects have made in their Brain, and often add more to them; and yet would have God cure them by a Miracle: Like to wounded Men, who in the exceſs of their Pain rend their Cloaths, tear up their Wounds, and then at the ſight of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death, complain of the Cruelty of their Surgeons. They would have God ſave them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſay they, he is Good, Wiſe and Powerful; and need but Will it, and we are Happy. He ought not ſurely to have made us to Damn us. But they ought to know that God has done all that could be done by Order and Wiſdom, which he conſults. We ſhould not believe that he leaves us, ſince he has given us his own Son to be our Mediator and Sacrifice. Yes, God would have us all ſaved: But by ſuch wayes as we ought carefully to ſtudy, and exactly to follow. He conſults not our Paſſions in the execution of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; but only his Wiſdom, and follows Order: And Order requires us to imitate <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> and to follow his Counſel, that we may be ſanctified and ſaved. But if God has not predeſtinated all Men to be conformable to the Image of his Son, who is the Model and Exemplar; 'tis becauſe in this he acts
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:107782:247"/>by the moſt ſimple wayes in relation to his deſigns, which tend all to his Glory: And God is an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Cauſe, and ought not to act like Particular Cauſes, which have particular wills for whatever they do. 'Tis alſo becauſe his Wiſdom, which in this reſpect is an Abyſs to our Underſtandings, wills it ſhould be ſo. In fine, 'Tis becauſe this conduct is more worthy of God, than any other which would be more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reprobates: For even the Order which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them is as worthy of our Adorations, as that whereby the Elect are ſanctified and ſaved. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our Ignorance of Order, and our Self-love, could make us condemn ſuch a Conduct as Angels and Saints will eternally admire. But let us return to the Proofs of the Efficacy of Second Cauſes.</p>

I confeſs this diſtinction may paſs from the Mouth of Divines; if by <hi>Natural</hi> Effects they mean thoſe which are conſequences of General Laws that God has eſtabliſhed for the general production and preſervation of all things; and that <hi>Supernatural</hi> Effects are ſuch as depend not upon theſe Laws. In
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:107782:247"/>this ſenſe this diſtinction is true. But the Philoſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> joyn'd to the impreſſion of the Senſes, I think makes it dangerous; becauſe this diſtinction may turn thoſe from God, who have too much reſpect for the Opinions of this wretched Philoſopher; or ſuch as conſult their Senſes inſtead of entering within themſelves, to ſeek the Truth there. So that we ought not to make uſe of this diſtinction without explaining it. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> having uſed the word <hi>Fortune,</hi>

And more than we ſuppoſe, who inconſiderately attribute the Works of God to it; who are taken up with this Idol, or Fiction of Mans Mind, and render it <hi>Honours,</hi> which are only due to the Divinity. They are willing that God ſhould be the Author of Miracles, and certain extraordinary Effects, which in one ſenſe are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Greatneſs and Wiſdom; and they refer to the Power of their imaginary <hi>Nature,</hi> thoſe conſtant and regulated Effects, that Wiſe Men only know how to admire. They likewiſe pretend that this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition, which all living Bodies have to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves, and beget their like, is a production of <hi>Nature:</hi> For according to theſe Philoſophers, 'tis the Sun and Moon which begets a Man.</p>
                     <p>We may further diſtinguiſh <hi>Supernatural</hi> from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Order, in many reſpects. For we may ſay, that the <hi>Supernatural</hi> refers to future good; that it is eſtabliſhed in conſideration of the Merits of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> that it is the firſt and chief of all Gods deſigns; and many other things ſufficient to preſerve a diſtinction, which they are vainly apprehenſive ſhould fall to the ground.</p>

                     <head>The Sixth Proof.</head>
                     <p>The Chief Proof that Philoſophers bring to prove the Efficacy of Second Cauſes, is deducted from the Will and Liberty of Man. Man wills, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines of himſelf, and to will and determine is to act. It is certain, it is Man who commits ſin; God is no more the Author of it, than he is of Concupiſcence and Error. Therefore Man acts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ANSWER.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In many places of <hi>the Search after Truth</hi> I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently explained what the Will and Liberty of Man is, and principally in the Firſt Chapter of the Firſt Book, and in the Firſt Explanation upon that Chapter: It is uſeleſs to repeat it here. I confeſs that Man wills and determines of himſelf; becauſe God makes him will, and continually inclines him towards Good, and gives him all the Ideas and Senſations which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him. I alſo acknowledge, that Man of himſelf commits ſin: But I deny, that in that he does any thing; for Sin, Error, and even Concupiſcence are nothing. Which Point I have ſufficiently cleared in the Firſt Explanation.</p>
                     <p>Man wills, but his Determinations are weak in themſelves, they produce nothing, nor hinder God from doing all Things; for it is even he who cauſes our Wills in us, by the impreſſion he gives us towards God: Man of himſelf is only capable of Errour and Sin, which are nothing.</p>
                     <p>There is a great deal of difference between our Minds and the Bodies which are about us: Our Mind in one ſenſe wills,<note place="margin">Nemo habet de ſuo niſi mendacium &amp; pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum. <hi>Conc. Arauſ. 2. Can. 22.</hi>
                        </note> acts, and determines; I grant it. Of which we are convinced by the inward ſenſation we have of our ſelves. To deny our Liberty, would be to take from us future rewards and puniſhments; for without Liberty there is neither good nor bad Actions: So that then Religion would
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:107782:248"/>be an Illuſion and a Fancy. But that Bodies have any power to Act, is what we do not clearly ſee, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears incomprehenſible; and is alſo what we deny when we reject Second Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Even the Mind does not act ſo much as we imagine. I know that I Will, and Will freely; I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of it, which is ſtronger than that inward ſenſation I have of my ſelf. I likewiſe don't deny this. But I deny that my Will is the True Cauſe of the Motion of my Arm, the Ideas of my Mind, and other Things which attend my Determinations; for I ſee no relation between Things which differ ſo much: On the contrary, I clearly diſcover that there can be no relation between the Will I have to move my Arm,<note place="margin">According to the ſenſe diſcuſſed in the Chapter upon which this Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is made.</note> and between the Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome little Bodies of which I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know the Motion nor Figure; which make choice of certain Nervous paſſages amongſt a Million of others I know not, to cauſe that Motion in me which I wiſh, by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of Motions I wiſh not. I deny that my Will produces my Ideas in me; for I do not ſo much as ſee how it could produce them: For ſince my Will cannot Act or Will without knowing, it ſuppoſes my Ideas, but does not make them. Nay, I do not ſo much as preciſely know what an Idea is. I cannot tell whether they are produced out of nothing, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nothing again as ſoon as we ceaſe to behold them. I ſpeak according to the Opinion of ſome perſons.</p>
                     <p>I produce, they will tell me, my Ideas by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty God hath given me of Thinking. And move my Arm becauſe of the Union God has placed between my Mind and Body. But <hi>Faculty</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> are Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Terms; rambling and indeterminate Words. There is no Being whatever, nor Manner of Being, which is either a <hi>Faculty</hi> or an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion:</hi> Therefore theſe Terms muſt be explained. If they will ſay, That the Union of my Mind with my Body conſiſts in Gods Willing, that when I wiſh my Arm ſhould be moved, the Animal Spirits are then diſperſed into the
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:107782:249"/>Muſcles of it, to move it according to my deſire. I clearly underſtand this Explanation, and receive it: But it is the ſame Thing which I maintain. For if my Will determine that of God, it is evident my Arm will be moved, not by my Will which is impotent in it ſelf, but by that of Gods which can never fail of its effect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">I always mean a true and efficacious power.</note>But if it be ſaid, That the Union of my Mind with my Body conſiſts in Gods having given me the power to move my Arm, as he has given my Body the power of feeling pleaſure and pain, that I might be aſſiduous about my Body, and intereſt my ſelf in its preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Certainly by this we ſhould ſuppoſe the Matter in diſpute, and make a Circle on't. We have no clear Idea of this power that the Soul has over the Body, nor of that the Body has over the Soul: Nor very well know what we ſay when we poſitively affirm it. Prejudice firſt gave riſe to this Opinion; we believed it from Infants, as ſoon as we were capable of ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But the Underſtanding, Reaſon, and Reflection have no ſhare in it, as ſufficiently appears by what I have ſaid in the <hi>Search after Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they will ſay, I know by the inward ſenſation of my Action that I truly have this power: So that I ſhall not be deceived in believing it. To which I Anſwer, When we move our Arm, we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſation of the Actual Will whereby we move it, and are not miſtaken when we believe we have this Will. And further, We have an inward ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a certain Effort which accompanies this Will; and we ought likewiſe to believe, that we make this Effort. In ſhort, I mean that we have an inward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that the Arm is moved in the very inſtant of the Effort: Which ſuppoſed, I conſent to what is ſaid, That the Motion of the Arm is performed in the ſame inſtant we feel this Endeavour; or that we have a <hi>practical</hi> Will to move it.<note place="margin">It appears evident to me, that the mind does not ſo much as know by inward ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Conſcience, the Motion of the Arm which it animates. It knowes by Conſcience only what it feels or thinks. We know the ſenſe we have of the Motion of our Arm by inward Senſation or Conſcience: But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience does not inform us of the Motion of our Arm, or the pain we ſuffer in it, any more than the Colours we ſee upon Objects.: Or if this will not be granted, I ſay that inward ſenſation is not infallible; for Errour is often found in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Senſation, as has been ſhewed in the Firſt Booke of the <hi>Search after Truth.</hi>
                        </note> But I deny that this Effort, which is only a Modification or Senſation of the Soul, given us to make us apprehend our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and which affords us but an obſcure
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:107782:249"/>and weak diſcovery of our power, ſhould be capable of moving or determining the Animal Spirits. I deny that there is any relation between our Thoughts and the Motions of Matter; or that the Soul has the leaſt knowledge of the Animal Spirits it makes uſe of to move the Body it Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. In fine, although the Soul ſhould exactly know the Animal Spirits, and ſhould be capable of Moving them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining their Motion; I deny that (with all this advantage) it could be capable of making choice of thoſe Nervous Canals of which ſhe is wholly ignorant, ſo as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Spirits into them, that thereby the Body might be moved with that quickneſs, exactneſs, and ſtrength, as we obſerve in thoſe who are leaſt acquainted with the Structure of their Bodies.</p>
                     <p>For even ſuppoſing our Wills were truly the Moving power of Bodies, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it appears incomprehenſible) how could we conceive that the Soul could move the Body? The Arm, (for Inſtance) is only moved by means of the dilatation or contraction of ſome of the Muſcles which compoſe it. And that the Motion which the Soul impreſſes on the Spirits that are in the Brain, may be communicated to thoſe in the Nerves, and theſe to others which are in the Muſcles of the Arms, it's requiſite that the Determinations of the Soul ſhould be multiplied or changed in proportion to the almoſt infinite Occurrences, or Shocks, which would be made by the little Bodies which conſtitute the Spirits. But this cannot be conceived without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting in the Soul an infinite number of Wills at the leaſt Motion of the Body; ſince to move it, an infinite number of communications of Motions are neceſſary: For the Soul being but a particular Cauſe, and which cannot exactly know either the greatneſs, or number, of an infinite Variety of little Bodies which mutually ſtrike each other when the Spirits are diſperſed
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:107782:250"/>into the Muſcles, it could neither eſtabliſh a general Law for the communication of the Motions of theſe Spirits, nor exactly follow it if it were eſtabliſhed. So that it is plain, the Soul could not move its Arm, although it had the power of determining the Motion of the Animal Spirits. Theſe Things are too clear for us to ſtand any longer upon them.</p>
                     <p>It is the ſame thing with our Faculty of Thinking. By inward ſenſation we know that we would think on ſomething and make ſome effort to that end; and that in the inſtant of our Deſire and Endeavour the Idea of this Thing preſents it ſelf to the Mind. But we do not diſcover by inward ſenſation, that our Will or Endeavour produces our Idea; nor does Reaſon tell us it can do it. It is through Prejudice that we are perſwaded that our Deſires cauſe our Ideas; whilſt we prove an hundred times a day, that the latter follows or attends the former. As God and his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have nothing ſenſible in them, and as we do not feel any thing elſe but our Deſires which precede the preſence of our Ideas; we think there can be no other Cauſe of them. But if we obſerve the Matter more cloſely, we ſhall diſcover we have no power in our ſelves to produce them: For neither Reaſon, nor the inward ſenſation we have of our ſelves give us any information of it.</p>
                     <p>I do not think I am obliged to relate all the other Proofs that are made uſe of by theſe Defenders of the Efficacy of Second Cauſes; becauſe they appear ſo weak, that it might be imagined I only intended to render them ridiculous, and if I ſhould anſwer them ſeriouſly I ſhould become ridiculous my ſelf. An Author (for Inſtance) aſſerts very ſeriouſly, in favour of his Opinion, <hi>That Created Beings are True, Material, Formal, Final Cauſes; and why then ſhould they not alſo be Efficient or Efficacious Cauſes?</hi> I believe I ſhould not very well ſatisfie the World, if in Anſwer to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of this Author, I ſhould ſtay to explain ſo groſs an Equivocation; and ſhow the difference between an Efficacious Cauſe, and that which ſome Philoſophers have been pleaſed to call a Material one. So that I
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:107782:250"/>ſhall omit ſome of the like Proofs, to come to thoſe they have taken from the Holy Scripture.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>ANSWER.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, That in the Holy Scripture there is alſo many paſſages which attribute to God the pretended Efficacy of Second Cauſes: of which theſe are ſome: <hi>Ego ſum Dominus faciens OMNIA, extendens Coelos SOL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, ſtabiliens terram, &amp; N<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S mecum,</hi> Iſa. 44.24. <hi>Manus tuae fecerunt me, &amp; plaſmaverunt me TOT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M in circuitu,</hi> Job 10.8. <hi>Neſcio qualiter in utero meo apparuiſtis ſingulorum membra, NON EGO IPSA COMPEGI, ſed enim Mundi Creator qui hominis formavit nativitatem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mac.</hi> l. 2. c. 7.22, 23. <hi>Cum ipſe DE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S dat omnibus vitam, inſpiratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp; omnia,</hi> Acts 17.25. <hi>Producens foenum jumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:107782:251"/>&amp; herbam ſervituti hominum, ut educas panem de terrâ,</hi> Pſal. 103. &amp; 48. There is an infinite number of the like paſſages, but theſe may ſuffice.</p>
                     <p>When an Author ſeems to contradict himſelf, and Natural Equity, or ſome ſtronger Reaſon obliges us to reconcile him to himſelf: It ſeems to me that we have an infallible Rule to diſcover his true Opinion; ſince we need but obſerve when he ſpeaks according to his own Underſtanding, and when in compliance with the common Opinion. When a Man ſpeaks like the reſt of the World, it is not alwayes a certain ſign he is of their Opinion: But when he ſpeaks poſitively contrary to what we are accuſtomed to ſay, although he ſhould ſay it but once, we have a great deal of Reaſon to believe 'tis what he thinks; provided we know he ſpeaks ſeriouſly, and having firſt well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it.</p>
                     <p>For inſtance: An Author ſpeaking of the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Animals, if he ſhould in an hundred places ſay, that Beaſts feel, that Dogs know their Maſter, love and fear him; and ſhould only in two or three places ſay, Beaſts are inſenſible, and Dogs uncapable of knowing, loving, or fearing any thing. How ſhall we reconcile this Author, who appears to contradict himſelf? Muſt we not collect all the paſſages for and againſt it, and judge of his Opinion by the greateſt number? If ſo, I don't believe there is any Man to whom, for example, we may attribute this Opinion, that Animals have no Souls: For the <hi>Carteſians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves often ſay, that a Dog feels when he is beaten; and 'tis very rarely that they deny him feeling. And although I have incountered an infinite number of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices in this Book, we may draw many paſſages from thence; whereby if this Rule I have explained be received, we may prove that I have eſtabliſhed them all; and even that I hold the Opinion of the Efficacy of Second Cauſes, which I have juſt now Refuted: Or perhaps it might be concluded, That <hi>The Search after Truth,</hi> is a Book full of viſible and groſs Contradictions; as ſome Perſons do, who it
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:107782:251"/>may be have not equity or penetration enough to make them fit Judges of the Works of others.</p>
                     <p>The Holy Scripture, the Fathers, and moſt good Men, oftener ſpeak of ſenſible Goods, Riches, and Honours, according to the common Opinion, than according to the true Ideas they have of them. <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> introduces <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the wicked Rich Man; <hi>Fili recepiſti BONA in vita tua; Thou haſt received thy good things in thy life time;</hi> that is, Riches, Honours. What we through prejudice call <hi>good,</hi> our good, that is our Gold or our Silver, is in an hundred places in the Scripture, called our <hi>Maintenance,</hi> or our <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and even our <hi>Honeſty,</hi> or that which honours us, <hi>Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertas &amp; honeſtas á Deo ſunt.</hi> But muſt this manner of ſpeaking, uſed by the Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.14.</note> and moſt Pious Perſons, make us think they contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or that they look upon Riches and Honours as real goods, and that therefore we ought to love and ſeek after them? No, without doubt; becauſe theſe wayes of ſpeaking, complying with prejudices, ſignifie nothing: And we ſee in other places, <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> has compared Riches to Thorns; has told us we muſt renounce them, becauſe they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful; and that whatſoever is great and alluring in this World, is an abomination before God. We muſt not therefore collect the paſſages of Scripture, or of the Fathers, to judge of their Opinion by the greateſt number of them, except we would continually attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the moſt unreaſonable prejudices to them.</p>
                     <p>This once ſuppoſed, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.28, 29, 30.</note> we ſee that the Holy Scripture poſitively ſayes, That 'tis God who has Created every thing, even <hi>the graſs of the field:</hi> That 'tis <hi>he who cloaths the Lillies</hi> with ſuch ornaments, as our <hi>SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> prefers before the Glory of <hi>Solomon.</hi> There is not only two or three, but an infinite number of paſſages which aſcribe to God the pretended Efficacy of Second Cauſes, and which deſtroy the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Peripatetics.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, we are carried by a kind of Natural Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, not to think on God in common Effects, and
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:107782:252"/>to attribute Power and Efficacy to Natural Cauſes; and ſeldom any thing but Miracles induce us to think on him as the Author of them: And the ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ingages us in favour of Second Cauſes. Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers hold this Opinion; becauſe ſay they, the Senſes convince us of it; and this is their ſtrongeſt Proof. Laſtly, This Opinion is received by all thoſe who follow the Judgments of the Senſes. Our common Language is formed from this prejudice; and we as generally ſay, that Fire has a power to burn, as we call Gold and Silver our good. Therefore the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages drawn from the Holy Scriptures, or the Fathers, for the Efficacy of Second Cauſes, prove no more than thoſe that an Ambitious or Covetous Man ſhall chooſe to juſtifie his own Conduct. But 'tis quite different with thoſe paſſages we may bring to prove that God does all things. For this Opinion being contrary to Prejudice, theſe paſſages muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in their utmoſt rigour; for the ſame Reaſon that we ought to believe that 'tis the Sentiments of the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> that Beaſts are inſenſible; although they have ſaid it but two or three times, and continually ſay to the contrary in all familiar Diſcourſes, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they feel, ſee, and underſtand.</p>
                     <p>In the Firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> God commands the Earth to produce Plants and Animals; and likewiſe the Waters to bring forth Fiſh. And conſequently ſayes the <hi>Peripatetics,</hi> Water and Earth have received a <hi>Power</hi> capable of producing theſe Effects.</p>
                     <p>I don't ſee the certainty of this Concluſion: And although we were even obliged to explain this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it ſelf, without having any recourſe to other paſſages of Scripture, there would be no neceſſity to receive this conſequence. This way of explaining the Creation is accommodated to our conception of things; therefore 'tis not neceſſary to take it literally; nor ought we to make uſe of it to maintain Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. As Animals and Plants are upon the Earth, Fowls live in the Air, and Fiſh in the Water; ſo God to make us apprehend 'tis by his Order they are in theſe places, has produced them there. 'Tis from the
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:107782:252"/>Earth that he formed Animals and Plants; not that the Earth was capable of generating them, or that God to that end gave it a Power or Vertue which it ſtill keeps; (for we all agree, that the Earth does not produce Horſes or Oxen) but becauſe from the Earth the Bodies of theſe Animals, were formed; as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the following Chapter: <hi>Formatis igitur Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Deus de humo cunctis animantibus Terrae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>&amp; univerſis volatilibus Coeli.</hi> Animals were formed out of the Earth, <hi>formatis de humo,</hi> and not produced by the Earth. Alſo after <hi>Moſes</hi> has related how Beaſts and Fiſh were produced by vertue of the Command which God gave the Earth and Water to produce them; he adds, that 'twas <hi>God himſelf who made them,</hi> that we might not attribute their production to the Earth and Water. <hi>CREAVIT quae DE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S cete gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia; &amp; omnem animam viventem atque notabilem quam PROD<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>XER<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NT aquae in ſpecies ſuas, &amp; omne volatile ſecundùm genus ſuum.</hi> And a little lower, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſpoken of the formation of Animals, he adds; <hi>Et FECIT DE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S beſtias terrae juxta ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſuas &amp; jumenta, &amp; omne reptile terrae in genere ſuo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may obſerve by the by, that where the Vulgar reads it, <hi>Producant aquae reptile animae viventis &amp; vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſuper terram;</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> has it, <hi>Volatile VOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TET:</hi> For as it clearly appears by the paſſage I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the Second Chapter, this word omitted ſhows that Fowls were not produced from the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that the deſign of <hi>Moſes</hi> is not here to prove that the Waters had received a true <hi>Power</hi> to bring forth Fiſh and Fowl, but only to denote the place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for each by the Order of God, whether to live or be produced in: And <hi>volatile VOLITET ſuper terram:</hi> For commonly when we ſay that the Earth produces Trees and Plants, we only deſign to ſhow, that it ſupplyed them with the Water and Salt which is neceſſary for their Germination and Growth. But I will ſtay no longer to explain the other paſſages of Scripture, which, literally taken, favour Second Cauſes; for we are not obliged: Beſides 'twould be
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:107782:253"/>very dangerous to underſtand ſuch expreſſions lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as are maintained upon common Opinions, agreeably to which the Language is formed; the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſpeaking every thing according to the impreſſion of the Senſes, and prejudices of Infancy.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Reaſon which obliges us to take ſuch paſſages of the Scripture in the Letter, as are directly oppoſite to Prejudices, ſtill gives us juſt cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Fathers never deſigned either to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of Second Cauſes, or the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> For although they often ſpoke after ſuch a manner as favoured Prejudices and the Judgments of the Senſes,<note place="margin">Omnia quippe por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenta contra Naturam dicimus eſſe, ſed non ſunt quomodo enim eſt contra Naturam quod Dei fit voluntate: Cum volantes tanti utique conditorio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditae rei cujuſque Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura ſit? Portentum ergo fit non contra Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam ſed contra quam eſt nota Natura. <hi>St.</hi> Aug. <hi>de Civitate Dei, l. 21. c. 8.</hi>
                        </note> they ſometimes ſo explained themſelves as ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the diſpoſition of their Mind and Heart. St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> for inſtance, believed the Will of God to be the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of every thing; as he declares when he ſpeaks thus; <hi>We are wont to ſay, that Prodigies are againſt Nature; but 'tis not true: For the Will of the Creator being the Nature of all Creatures, how can what is performed by the Will of God be contrary to Nature? Miracles or Prodigies therefore are not against Nature, but only againſt what we know of Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks in many places according to Prejudices: But I affirm that proves nothing, ſince we ought to explain literally only ſuch paſſages as are oppoſite to Prejudices; for the Reaſons I have already given.</p>
                     <p>If St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in all his Works had never ſaid any thing againſt the Efficacy of Second Cauſes, but had alwayes favoured this Opinion, we might perhaps make uſe of his Authority to eſtabliſh it. Yet if it does not appear that he ever ſeriouſly examined this Queſtion, we ſhould alwayes have had Reaſon to think, that his Judgment was not determined upon this Subject; and that 'twas not impoſſible but he might be drawn by the impreſſion of his Senſes, without Reflection, to have believed a thing which
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:107782:253"/>appeared undoubted, until it was carefully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, for inſtance, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> alwayes ſpoke of Beaſts as if they had a Soul; I don't ſay a Corporeal one; for that Holy Father too well knew the diſtinction between the Soul and Body, to believe there were Corporeal Souls. I ſay, a Spiritual Soul, for Matter is incapable of Senſation: Yet I believe it more reaſonable to make uſe of his Authority to prove, that Beaſts have no Souls; than to prove they have any: For from the Principles he has carefully examined, and ſtrongly eſtabliſh'd, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly follows they have none;<note place="margin">Some of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Principles are theſe; That what has not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned can never ſuffer evil. Now according to him, Pain is the greateſt evil, and Beaſts ſuffer it. That the moſt noble cannot have the leaſt noble for its end. But with him the Soul of Beaſts is Spiritual, and more noble than the Body; and yet has no other end than the Body. That what is Spiritual is Immortal; and the Soul of Beaſts that's Spiritual is ſubject to Death. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch like Principles in the Works of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> from whence it may be concluded, that Beaſts have no ſuch Spiritual Soul as he admits in them. See <hi>c. 22, 23. de Anima &amp; ejus ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</hi>
                        </note> as is ſhown by <hi>Ambroſe Victor</hi> in his Sixth Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of Chriſtian Philoſophy. But the Sentiment that Beaſts have a Soul, or feel Pain when they are beaten, being agreeable to Prejudices, for there's no Child who does not believe it, we have alwayes reaſon to think that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks upon this matter, according to the general Opinion, and never ſeriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the Queſtion; and that if he had but begun to doubt and make any refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon it, he would not have ſaid a thing which is ſo contrary to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                     <p>Thus although the Fathers ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have favoured the Efficacy of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, perhaps we ſhould not have been obliged to have had any regard to their Opinion, if it had appeared that they had not carefully examined the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And that what they ſhould have ſaid, had been only a Conſequence of the Language which is formed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon Prejudice. But 'tis certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the contrary: For the Fathers, the moſt Pious Perſons, and thoſe who have been beſt inſtructed in Religion, have commonly ſnown by ſome places of their
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:107782:254"/>Works, what was the diſpoſition of theis Mind and Heart, in reſpect to this matter.</p>
                     <p>The moſt Learned, and alſo the greateſt number of Divines, ſeeing on one ſide that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was contrary to the Efficacy of Second Cauſes; and on the other, that the impreſſion of the Cauſes; publick Laws, and chiefly the Philoſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> eſtabliſhed it: For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought that God did not concern himſelf in Sublunary Affairs, becauſe it was unworthy his grandeur: And that <hi>Nature</hi> which he ſuppoſed in all Bodies was ſufficient to produce what happened here below. The Divines I ſay, have found this Medium to reconcile Faith with the Heathen Philoſophy, and Reaſon with the Senſes; that Second Cauſes do nothing, except God <hi>concurs</hi> with them. But becauſe this immediate concourſe, whereby God acts with Second Cauſes, includes great difficulties, ſome Philoſophers have rejected it; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that in order to their acting, 'twas enough if God preſerved them with the ſame, <hi>vertue</hi> he at firſt created them. And becauſe this Opinion is abſolutely conformable to Prejudice, and becauſe the operation of God in Second Cauſes is not ſenſible, it is therefore commonly received by the Vulgar, and by thoſe who apply themſelves more to the Phyſicks of the Antients, than to Divinity and the Meditation of the Truth. The generality of the World believe that God at firſt Created all things, and gave them all the neceſſary qualities or faculties for their preſervation: That he has, for inſtance, given the firſt Motions to Matter, and afterwards left it to it ſelf, to produce by the Communication of its Motions this variety of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable forms. We commonly ſuppoſe that Bodies can move one another, and even attribute this Opinion to <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> although he expreſly ſpeaks againſt it in the 36th and 37th Articles of the Second Part of his Philoſophical Principles. Though Man cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf from acknowledging that the Creatures depend upon God, yet he leſſens this dependence as much as poſſible; either through a ſecret averſion to God, or a wretched ſtupidity and inſenſibility in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:107782:254"/>to his operation. But as this Sentiment is chiefly received by thoſe who have not much ſtudied Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and who often rather follow their Senſes, and the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> than their Reaſon, and that of the Holy Scriptures; we have not ſo much reaſon to fear its eſtabliſhment in the Minds of thoſe who have any love for Truth and Religion: For a little Application in the Examination of this Opinion will eaſily diſcover its falſity. But that Notion of the <hi>immediate concourſe</hi> of God to each action of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, ſeems to agree with thoſe paſſages of Scripture which often attribute the ſame effect both to God and the Creatures.</p>
                     <p>We muſt conſider then, that there are places in Scripture where God is only ſaid to act; <hi>Ego ſum Dominus,</hi> ſayes <hi>Iſaiah, faciens OMNIA extendens Coelos SOL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S ſtabiliens terram,</hi>

Therefore according to the Principle I have before eſtabliſhed, theſe paſſages muſt be explain'd literally. But on the contrary, the Opinion of the Efficacy of Second Cauſes being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the common Notion, and impreſſion of the Senſes,<note place="margin">Sol &amp; homo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hominem. <hi>Ariſt.

                     <pb n="802" facs="tcp:107782:255"/>
                     <p>But although the immediate concourſe of God with Second Cauſes, ſhould be proper to reconcile theſe different Texts, I know not whether it ought to be admitted after all: For the Sacred Books were not made for the Divines of theſe times; but for the <hi>Jews.</hi> So that if the <hi>Jews</hi> were not formerly ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, or ſubtle enough to imagine ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as is admitted in our School-Divinity, and to reconcile a thing that the moſt able Divines have had much trouble to explain; it follows, methinks, that the Holy Scripture, which attributed to God, and to him only, the production and preſervation of all things, would have thrown them into Error; and that the Holy Penmen of theſe Books, would have ſpoke to Men, not only in an unknown but deceitful Language. For by telling them that God does all things, they would only have intended, that God gives his <hi>concourſe</hi> to all things; and 'tis probable, the <hi>Jews</hi> never ſo much as thought of this <hi>concourſe;</hi> thoſe amongſt them that were not great Philoſophers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that God did all things, and not that he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred</hi> to all.</p>
                     <p>But that we may make a more certain Judgment about this <hi>Concourſe,</hi> it would be very proper, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to explain the different <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the Schools about it: For beſides the impenetrable obſcurities which are common to all Opinions, that we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain or maintain only upon rambling and indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate terms; there are upon this matter ſo great a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Opinions, that it would not be very difficult to diſcover the cauſe of them. But I will not ingage in a diſcuſſion which will be too tireſom both for my ſelf, and the greateſt part of thoſe who will read this Book. I rather chooſe on the contrary to endeavour to ſhow, that my Opinions may in ſome reſpect be reconciled to the greateſt number of the School Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, although I muſt not diſſemble, but confeſs their Language appears very equivocal and confuſed to me. I will explain my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>I believe, as I have already ſaid elſewhere, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for inſtance, have no power to move themſelves,
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:107782:255"/>and that their Moving Power is only the action of God: Or to avoid a term which ſignifies nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, their Moving Power is only the Will of God, alwayes neceſſarily efficacious, which ſucceſſively pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them in different places. For I don't believe that God creates certain Beings, to make them the Moving Power of Bodies: Not only becauſe I have no Idea of this kind of Being, nor ſee how they could move Bodies; but alſo ſince theſe Beings would themſelves have need of ſome others to move them, and ſo on <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> For none but God is truly immovable, and ſole Mover together.</p>
                     <p>Which being ſuppoſed; when a Body ſtrikes and moves another, I may ſay, that it acts by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of God, and that this Concourſe is not diſtinct from its own action. For a Body moves another which it meets, only by its Action or Moving Power; which at the bottom is nothing but the Will of God, that ſucceſſively preſerves this Body in many places: The transferring of a Body not being its Action or Moving Power, but the effect of its Moving Power. Moſt Divines likewiſe ſay, That the Action of Second Cauſes differs not from the Action whereby God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with them. For although they underſtand it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, they ſuppoſe that God acts in the Greatures, in the ſame Action with the Creatures. And they are it ſeems obliged to ſpeak thus: For if the Creatures acted by an Action which God did not produce in them, their Action conſidered as ſuch, would, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me, be independant: Now they believed, as they ought, that the Creatures depended immediately upon God, not only as to their Being, but alſo as to their Operation.</p>
                     <p>So in reſpect to Free Cauſes, I believe that God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually gave the Mind an impreſſion towards Good in general, and that he alſo determined this impreſſion towards particular Goods, by the Ideas or Senſations he has given us; as I have ſhewn in the Firſt Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: And 'tis the ſame Thing with what the Divines believe when they ſay, That God moves and prevents our Wills. So that the power which puts our Minds
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:107782:256"/>in motion, is the Will of God, which animates and inclines us towards Good: For God created not Beings to make them the Moving power of Minds, for the ſame Reaſon that he did not create any to make them the Moving power of Bodies. The Wills of God being Efficacious of themſelves, it is enough for him to Will a Thing to have it done: And it is uſeleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily to multiply Beings. Beſides, whatever is real in the determinations of our Motions, likewiſe proceeds from the Action of God in us, as is clear from the Firſt Explanation: Now we neither Act or produce any Thing but by our Wills, I mean by the impreſſion of the Will of God which is our Moving power. For our Wills are Efficacious no farther than as they proceed from God; even as Bodies put in motion, impell not others, but in as much as they have a Moving power which transfer them, and this Moving power is only the Will of God which creates or ſucceſſively preſerves them in different places. Then we Act only by the Concourſe of God; and our Action conſidered? as Efficacious and capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any Effect differs not from that of God's: And is as moſt Divines ſay, the very ſame Action: <hi>Eadem numero Actio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now all the Changes which happen in the World,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez <hi>l.</hi> 1. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſu Dei cum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> have no other Natural Cauſe, than the Motion of Bodies, and Wills of Spirits. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> According to the General Laws of the Communication of Motions, the inviſible Bodies which ſurround the viſible ones, by their divers Motions produce all theſe various Effects, the Cauſe of which does not appear to us. <hi>Secondly,</hi> According to the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, when Bodies which are about us Act upon ours, they produce in our Souls an infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Senſations, Ideas, and Paſſions. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Mind produces by its Wills a great many different Ideas in it ſelf: For it is our Wills which apply and modifie our Minds as Natural Cauſes, whoſe Efficacy nevertheleſs proceeds from the Laws which God has Eſtabliſhed. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> When our Mind Acts upon our Body, many Changes are therein produced by vertue
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:107782:256"/>of the Laws of its Union with it: And by the means of our Body it alſo produces in thoſe about it a great Number of Changes, by vertue of the Laws of the Communication of Motions. Thus all Natural Effects have no other Natural or Occaſional Cauſe, than the Motions of Bodies, and Wills of Spirits; which will eaſily be granted by any who will uſe but a little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; ſuppoſing he is not already prepoſſeſſed by ſuch as know not what they ſay, who inſtantly imagine Beings which they have no clear Idea of, and pretend to explain Things they underſtand not, by what is abſolutely incomprehenſible. So that God executing by his <hi>Concourſe,</hi> or rather by his Efficacious Will, whatever the Motions of Bodies, or Determinations of Spirits perform as Natural or Occaſional Cauſes; it's plain, God does every Thing by the ſame Action of the Creature: Not that Creatures of themſelves have any Efficacious Action, but becauſe the Power of God is in ſome ſort communicated to them by the Natural Laws which God has Eſtabliſhed in their favour.</p>
                     <p>This is all that I can ſay to reconcile my Thoughts with the Opinion of thoſe Divines who maintain the neceſſity of immediate Concourſe, and that God does All in all Things by the ſame Action as that of the Creatures: For as to the reſt of the Divines, I believe their Opinions are indeſenſible every way; and chiefly that of <hi>Durandus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

For although this Opinion be leſs perplexed than that of the other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, yet it appears to me ſo oppoſite to Scripture, and conformable to Prejudices, to ſay no more, that I believe it cannot be maintained.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs that the Schoolmen,<note place="margin">In <hi>4.</hi> Sent. Diſt. <hi>1. q.</hi> De alia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co. ibid.</note> who ſay, the immediate Concourſe of God is the ſame Action as that of the Creatures, do not abſolutely underſtand it according to my Explanation; And except <hi>Biel</hi> and Cardinal <hi>D' Ailly,</hi> all thoſe I have read, think that the Efficacy
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:107782:257"/>which produces Effects, proceeds from the Second Cauſe as well as the Firſt. But as I determined with my ſelf not to ſay any thing but what I conceive clearly, and always take that Side which beſt agrees with Religion; I believe it will not be taken amiſs if I forſake an Opinion which to many perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo much the more intricate, as they endeavour more aſſiduouſly to apprehend it: And ſince I have eſtabliſhed another which agrees perfectly, not only with Reaſon, but alſo with the Holineſs of Religion and Chriſtian Morality. 'Tis a Truth I have already proved in the Chapter upon which I make theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; but it will be very proper for me to offer yet ſomething more fully, to Juſtifie what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid upon the preſent Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon and Religion convinces us than God would be loved and rever'd by his Creatures; Loved as good, and Rever'd as powerful: Which is a Truth we cannot doubt of without impiety and folly. To love God as he requires and deſerves to be loved, we muſt according to the Firſt Command both of the Law and Goſpel, and even of Reaſon, as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhown, do it with all our ſtrength, or according to the utmoſt Capacity we have of Loving. It is not enough to prefer him to all Things, but we muſt alſo love him in all Things: Elſe is not our Love ſo perfect as it ought to be;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>l.</hi> 4. ch. 1.</note> nor do we give to God all the Love he has impreſſed upon us, and that only for himſelf, ſince all his Actions center in himſelf. Likewiſe to render to God all the Reverence due to him, it is not enough to adore him as the Soveraign Power, and fear him more than any of his Creatures: We muſt alſo fear and adore him in all his Creatures, and all our Actions muſt tend towards him; for Honour and Glory are due only to him. Which is what God has commanded us in theſe Words: <hi>Diliges Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo &amp; ex tota anima tua,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; ex tota fortitudine tua:</hi> And in theſe; <hi>Dominum Deum tuum ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebis, &amp; illi ſoli ſervies.</hi> Thus the Philoſophy which teaches us, That the Efficacy of Second Cauſes is a Fiction of the Mind; that the Nature of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and ſome other
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:107782:257"/>Philoſophers, is a Chimera; that God only is ſtrong and powerful enough, not only to Act in our Souls, but alſo to give the leaſt Motion to Matter: This Philoſophy, I ſay agrees perfectly with Religion, the deſign of which is to unite us to God after the ſtricteſt manner.</p>
                     <p>We commonly love ſuch Things only as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing us ſome good: This Philoſophy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only Authoriſes the Love of God, and abſolutely condemns the Love of every Thing elſe. We ought to fear Nothing but what is able to do us ſome Evil: This Philoſophy therefore only permits us to fear God, and poſitively forbids our fearing any Thing elſe. So that it Juſtifies all the Motions of the Soul which are Juſt and Reaſonable; and condemns all thoſe that are contrary to Reaſon and Religion. For this Philoſophy will never Juſtifie the Love of Riches, the Deſire of Greatneſs, nor the Extravagance of Debauchery; ſince the Love of the Body appears mad and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, to the Principles eſtabliſhed by this Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an Undoubted Truth, a Natural Opinion, and even a common Notion, that we ought to love the Cauſe of our Pleaſure, and love it in proportion to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity it does or can make us enjoy. It is not only Juſt, but it is alſo very Neceſſary, that the Cauſe of our Happineſs ſhould be the Object of our Love. Thus following the Principles of this Philoſophy, we ought only to love God; for it tells us, that He alone is the True Cauſe of our Happineſs; that the Bodies which are about us cannot Act upon that which we Animate, conſequently much leſs upon our Minds. 'Tis not the Sun which enlightens us, and gives us Motion and Life; nor is it that which covers the Earth with Fruits and Flowers, and which ſupplies us with Food and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Philoſophy teaches us with the Scripture, that it is <hi>God only who gives Rain, and regulates the Seaſons; who gives Nouriſhment to the Body, and fills the Heart with Joy:</hi>

                        <hi>That he only is capable of doing us good; and thereby has given us a perpetual Teſtimony of what he is, although in Ages paſſed he has permitted all Nations to walk in their own ways.</hi> According to
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:107782:258"/>the Language of this Philoſophy, we muſt not ſay, That it is Nature that fills us with Good; nor that it is God and Nature together: But that it is God alone, ſpeaking thus without Equivocation, that we may not deceive the Simple. For we muſt diſtinctly acknowledge him the onely Cauſe of our Happineſs, if we would make him the onely Object of our Love.</p>
                     <p>'Tis likewiſe an undoubted Truth, That we ought to fear ſuch Things as are able to hurt us, and fear them in proportion to the Evil they can do us. But this Philoſophy tells us, That it is God alone that can do us Evil; that it is he, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays, <hi>who creates Darkneſs as well as Light: who makes peace, and creates Evil;</hi> and even that no Evil happens but from him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prophet. So that it is him alone we ought to fear. We muſt not fear either Plague, or War, Famine, our Enemies, nor even Devils themſelves; but God alone. We ought to fly a Sword, when ready to wound us, ſhun Fire, and avoid a Houſe that is likely to fall upon us; yet muſt not fear theſe Things: We may fly ſuch Bodies as are Occaſional or Natural Cauſes of Evil: but we muſt fear only God, as the <hi>True</hi> Cauſe of all Evils and Misfortunes; and only hate Sin, which neceſſarily provokes the Cauſe of all our Happineſs, to become the Cauſe of all our Evils. And in ſhort, all the Motions of our Minds ought to tend only to God, ſince He alone is Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to tend only to God, ſince He alone is Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to it, and the Motions of our Body may relate to thoſe about it. This is what we learn from that Philoſophy, which admits not the Efficacy of Second Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>But this Efficacy being ſuppoſed, I cannot ſee but we have ſome reaſon to fear and love Bodies: And that to regulate our Love according to Reaſon, it is enough to prefer God above every Thing elſe; the Firſt and Univerſal, to Second and Particular Cauſes.
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:107782:258"/>Then it is not neceſſary to love God with all our ſtrength; <hi>Ex totâ mente, ex toto corde, ex tota anima, ex totis viribus,</hi> at the Scripture ſays.</p>
                     <p>Yet when we content our ſelves with preferring God to all other Beings, and adore him with a Love of Eſteem and Preference, without continually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to honour and love him in all Things; it often happens that we deceive our ſelves, that our Charity is diſſipated and loſt, and that we are more taken up with Senſible, than the Soveraign Good: For if the greateſt Sinners, and it may be even Idolaters, were asked, If they preferred not the univerſal to particular Cauſes? They would not perhaps be afraid, in the midſt of their Debauches and Extravagancies, to Anſwer, That they failed not in ſo Eſſential a Duty, and knew very well what they owed to God. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they would deceive themſelves; but take away the Efficacy of Second Cauſes, and they will have no probable pretext to Juſtifie their Conduct: And if it be ſuppoſed, they may ſay this for themſelves, when their paſſions blind them, and they liſten to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Senſes. <q rend="margQuotes">"Since I am made to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, I neither can, nor ought to forbear loving and reſpecting whaterver may be the Cauſe of my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Why therefore ſhould I not love and reſpect Senſible Objects, ſince they are the True Cauſes of the Happineſs I receive in their Enjoyment? I acknowledge the Supream Being is alone worthy of our higheſt Adoration, and I prefer him to every Thing; but not ſeeing that he requires any Thing of me, I enjoy the Goods he has given me by the means of Second Cauſes, to which he has ſubjected me: and I pay no Acknowledgments to him, which perhaps would diſhonour him. As he does me no good immediately and by himſelf, or at leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance of the Creatures, it is a ſign he does not require my Mind and Heart ſhould be immediately applied to himſelf; or at leaſt he is willing, that the Creatures ſhould divide with him the Acknowledgments of my Heart and Mind: Since he has communicated a part of his Power and
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:107782:259"/>Glory to the Sun, has ſurrounded him with Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Majeſty, Eſtabliſhed him Supream over all his Works; and 'tis by the Influence of this Great Luminary that we receive all the Neceſſary Goods of Life: Why ſhould we not then employ a part of this Life in enjoying his Light, and teſtifying the ſenſe we have of his Greatneſs and Benefits? Would it not be the utmoſt Ingratitude to receive the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all Things from this Excellent Creature, and have no Sentiment of Gratitude for it? And would it not likewiſe be an unaccountable blindneſs and ſtupidity, to have no Motion of reſpect and fear for him whoſe abſence freezes us to death, and who by approaching too near us may burn up and deſtroy us? I ſay it again, that God is preferable to all Things, that we muſt eſteem and love him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more than the Creatures; but that we muſt alſo love and fear them: For thereby we honour Him who made them; merit his Favours; and oblige him to beſtow New Benefits upon us. It is plain, he approves of the Honour we pay his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſince he has communicated his Power to them; and all Power merits Honour. But as Honour ought to be proportioned to Power, and that the Power of the Sun, and all Senſible Objects, is ſuch, that from them we receive all ſorts of Goods, it is juſt we ſhould honour them with all our ſtrength, and next to God conſecrate our whole Being to them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we naturally reaſon, when we follow the Prejudice we have received from the Efficacy of Second Cauſes; 'tis probably after this manner that the firſt Authors of Idolatry reaſoned. Here is what he thought of it who is eſteemed the moſt Learned of the <hi>Jews.</hi> He thus begins a Treatiſe he wrote about Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the Days of</hi> Enos <hi>Men fell into ſtrange Deluſions,</hi>

                        <hi>and the Wiſe Men of that Time perfectly loſt their Senſe and Reaſon.</hi> Enos <hi>himſelf was in the Number of thoſe deceived Perſons. Theſe were their Errours. Since God (ſaid they) has created the Stars and the Heavens to govern the World, has placed them on high, ſurrounded
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:107782:259"/>them with brightneſs and glory, and employes them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>execute his Orders, it is juſt that we ſhould honour them, and pay reverence and homage to them. 'Tis the Will of our God that we ſhould honour thoſe whom he has raiſed and exalted in Glory; even as a Prince requires we ſhould honour his Miniſters in his preſence; becauſe the Honour we give to them redounds to himſelf. After they had once received this Notion, they began to build Temples in honour of the Stars, to offer Sacrifices and Praiſes to them, and even proſtrate themſelves before them, thinking thereby to gain the favour of him who created them. And this was the original of Idolatry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is ſo Natural and Juſt to have Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Acknowledgment in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Benefits we receive,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Voſſius, l. 2. <hi>de Idolatria.</hi>
                        </note> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the World have adored the Sun;<note place="margin">Ipſi qui irridentur <hi>Aegyptii,</hi> nullam bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luam niſi ob aliquam utilitatem quam ex ea caperent, conſecrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. <hi>Cic. l. 1.</hi> de Natura Deorum.</note> becauſe they all thought he was the cauſe of the Happineſs they injoyed. And if the <hi>Egyptians</hi> have adored not only the Sun, the Moon, and the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> becauſe its overflowings cauſed the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their Country, but alſo the vileſt Animals; 'twas, as <hi>Cicero</hi> relates, becauſe of ſome benefit they received from them. So that as we cannot, and indeed ought not to baniſh out of Mens Minds, the inclination they Naturally have for the true Cauſes of their Happineſs; it is evident that there is at leaſt ſome danger in maintaining the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Second Cauſes, although we joyn thereto the neceſſity of an <hi>immediate concourſe,</hi> which has I know not what of incomprehenſible in it, and which comes in as an after-game to juſtifie our Prejudices, and <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>But there is no danger in ſpeaking only what we know, and atributing Power and Efficacy to God alone; ſince we ſee nothing but his Wills which have an abſolute, neceſſary, and indiſpenſable connection with Natural Effects. I confeſs that Men are now knowing enough to avoid the groſs Errors of the Heathens and Idolaters: But I am not afraid to ſay, that our Mind is diſpoſed, or rather that our Heart is
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:107782:260"/>often inclined like that of the Heathens; and that there will alwayes be ſome kind of Idolatry in the World, until the day that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall again deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up his Kingdom to God his Father; having firſt deſtroyed all Empire, Power, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, that God may be all in all.<note place="margin">Quorum Deus ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſt, <hi>Phil. 13.9.</hi>

                           </p>
                        </note> For is it not a kind of Idolatry, to make a God of our Belly, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks? Is it not to idolize the God of Riches, continually to labour after Worldly Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions? Is this to render to God the Worſhip due to him; to adore him in Spirit and Truth; to have our Hearts filled with ſome ſenſible Beauty, and our Minds dazled with the brightneſs of ſome imaginary Grandeur.</p>
                     <p>Men believing they receive from the Bodies which are about them the Pleaſures they injoy by their uſe, they unite themſelves to them with all the Powers of their Soul: And thus the principal of their diſorder proceeds from the ſenſible conviction they have of the Efficacy of Second Cauſes. 'Tis Reaſon only that tells them, there is none but God acts in them. But beſides that, Reaſon ſpeaks ſo low that they can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear it; and the Senſes, which oppoſe it, cry ſo loud that it ſtupifies them; they are ſtill confirmed in their Prejudices by Arguments which are ſo much the more dangerous, as they bear external Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, and ſenſible Marks of Truth.</p>
                     <p>The Philoſophers, and chiefly the Chriſtian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, ought continually to oppoſe Prejudices, or the Judgments of the Senſes, and eſpecially ſuch dangerous ones as that of the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of Second Cauſes: And yet I know not from what Principle there are ſome Perſons (whom I extreamly honour, and that with reaſon) who endeavour to confirm this Prejudice, and even to make this Doctrine paſs for ſuperſtitious and extravagant, which is ſo holy, pure, and ſolid; and maintains that God alone is the true cauſe of every thing. They will not have us love and fear God in all things, but love and fear all things in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:107782:260"/>to God. We ought, ſay they, to love the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures becauſe they are good; to love and reſpect our Father; render honour to our Prince and Superiour, ſince God commands it. I don't deny it; but I deny that we muſt love the Creatures as our goods, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be good or perfect in themſelves. I deny that we are to pay ſervice and reſpect to Men as to our Maſters: For we muſt neither ſerve our Maſter, obey our Father, or Prince, with any other deſign but to ſerve God, and obey him. This is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, who became all things to all Men, and complyed in all things for the Salvation of thoſe to whom he Preached: <hi>Servi obedite Dominis carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus cum timore &amp; tremore in ſimplicitate cordis vestri SIC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T CHRISTO: Non ad oculum ſervientes quaſi omnibus placentes, ſed ut ſervi Chriſti facientes vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem Dei ex animo, cum bona voluntate ſervientes SIC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T DOMINI ET NON HOMINIB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> And in another Epiſtle: <hi>Non ad oculum ſervientes quaſi hominibus placentes, ſed in ſimplicitate cordis DE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M TIMENTES.

Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours would alwayes be more honoured, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerved. But I believe I may ſay, that a Maſter who would be honoured and ſerved, as having in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf another Power than that of God, muſt be a Devil; and that thoſe who ſerved him under that Notion, would be Idolaters; for I can't but believe that all Honour and Love that tend not towards God, are kinds of Idolatry.</p>

                  <head>AN EXPLANATION Of what I have ſaid in the Fourth Chapter of the Second Part, <hi>Of Method;</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</head>
                  <head type="sub">That God acts alwayes with Order, and by the moſt Simple Wayes.</head>
                  <p>IT ſeems to ſome Perſons to be too raſh a Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or an abuſing of indeterminate and general Terms, to ſay, That God acts alwayes with Order, and by the moſt ſimple wayes, in the execution of his deſigns: Therefore 'twill not be uſeleſs for me to prove and explain this Truth; for 'tis of the greateſt conſequence, not only for the knowledge of Nature, but much more for the knowledge of Religion and Morality.</p>
                  <p>By the word God, we underſtand a Being infinitely Perfect, whoſe Wiſdom and Knowledge have no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and who conſequently knows all the means whereby he can execute his deſigns. This being granted, I ſay, God acts alwayes by the ſhorteſt means, and moſt ſimple wayes.</p>
                  <p>That I may be the better underſtood, I'll make uſe of a ſenſible Example: I ſuppole that God wills the Body <hi>A,</hi> ſhould ſtrike the Body <hi>B.</hi> Since God knows
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:107782:261"/>every thing, he perfectly knows that <hi>A.</hi> can go to ſtrike <hi>B.</hi> by an infinite number of Curve-Lines, and but by one Right-Line only. Now God only wills the ſhock of <hi>B.</hi> by <hi>A.;</hi> and we ſuppoſe that he only wills the transferring of <hi>A.</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> to effect this ſhock: Therefore <hi>A.</hi> muſt be transferred to <hi>B.</hi> by the ſhorteſt way, or by a Right-Line. For if the Body <hi>A.</hi> were tranſported to <hi>B.</hi> by a Curve Line, that would ſhow, either that the Tranſporter knew no other way; or elſe that he not only will'd the concurrence of theſe Bodies, but alſo the means to produce it, which is againſt the ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>There's as much more action requiſite to transfer a Body <hi>A.</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> by a Curve-Line, than by a Right-Line, as the Curve is greater than the Right. If God therefore ſhould transfer <hi>A.</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> by a Curve-Line, which is double to a Right, half the Action of God would be wholly uſeleſs; conſequently produced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſign or end, as well as without effect.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Action in God is Will; therefore there muſt be more Will in God to cauſe <hi>A.</hi> to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported circularly, than directly. Now we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuppoſed that God had no Will in reſpect to the motion of <hi>A,</hi> but only as it relates to the ſhock: Therefore there is not Will enough in God to move <hi>A.</hi> by a Curve-Line. And conſequently this motion of <hi>A.</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> is a contradiction. Thus 'tis a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that God ſhould not act by the moſt ſimple wayes, except we ſuppoſe that God in the choice of wayes he makes uſe of to execute his deſigns, has ſomething elſe in view beſides theſe deſigns, which is a contradiction in our ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>When I ſay there is more Will in God to transfer a Body from <hi>A.</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> by a Curve, than by a Right Line; we muſt from thence conclude nothing againſt the ſimplicity of the Being and Action of God: For it muſt be confeſſed that it cannot be comprehended, either how the ſimplicity of an Infinite Being, includes all the different Perfections of Finite Beings; nor how his Will continuing alwayes the ſame, and alwayes conformable to Order, changes with reference to the
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:107782:262"/>different Beings it produces and preſerves. I ſpeak only according to our manner of conceiving. It ſeems to me now that we clearly conceive when God Wills, and, for inſtance, creates a Cubic Foot of Matter, he Wills another thing than if he creates two. For 'tis evident that God could not create two different things; nor know whether he had created one or two feet of Matter; or if he conveyed a Body circularly or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, if there was not ſome difference in his Wills in reſpect to Matter, or to its Motion; ſince God ſees only in himſelf, and in his Wills, the variety of his Creatures. Now whatever that Action is in God which relates to the different Beings he produces or preſerves; I call it the differences, augmentations, and diminutions of Wills in God. And according to this manner of conceiving things, I ſay, God cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy more Will than is neceſſary to execute his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: So that God alwayes acts by the moſt ſimple wayes in reference to them.</p>
                  <p>I don't deny however but God may have a great number of wayes, equally ſimple, to produce the ſame effects; or that he may produce them by different means; but he alwayes produces them by the moſt ſimple, provided they are all of the ſame kind; for 'tis a contradiction, that a Being infinitely Wiſe ſhould have uſeleſs and irregular Wills.</p>
                  <p>If we would apply this Principle to Morality, we ſhall ſee that thoſe ſecure their Salvation, who ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves for Grace, by Self-denyal, Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and an exact Obedience to the Commands of our Saviour, that God acting in them by the moſt ſimple wayes; I mean, by giving them but few New Graces, operates very much in them. For although God would have all Men be ſaved, he will only ſave thoſe that can be ſaved by the moſt ſimple means, which have relation to the great deſign he has of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying through <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> a certain number of the Elect; and he will multiply the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Eve</hi> till that number be fulfilled; for 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is willing to ſanctifie us through the moſt ſimple means, that after Sin, it was neceſſary for him
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:107782:262"/>to multiply the Children of Men to compleat the number of his Elect; ſince there are many perſons who cauſe their own Damnation by withdrawing themſelves from the Order of God.</p>
                  <p>Now as God acts not as a particular Cauſe, we muſt not imagine, that he has like us particular Wills for every thing he produces; for if it were ſo, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears evident to me, that the generation of Monſters would be impoſſible; and that it would never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that one work ſhould deſtroy another. As God cannot have contrary Wills, we ſhould have recourſe to a Principle of Evil, as the <hi>Manichses</hi> had, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to freeze the Fruits produced by God. This being ſo, we are methinks obliged to ſuppoſe, that there are ſome general Rules according to which God predeſtinates and ſanctifies the Elect; and that thoſe Laws are what we call the Order of Grace; as his general Wills, whereby God produces and preſerves whatever is in the World, are the Order of Nature.</p>
                  <p>I don't know whether I am not miſtaken; but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks from this Principle a great many Conſequences may be drawn, which perhaps would reſolve ſome Difficulties, about which there has been much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ſome years ſince; but I don't think my ſelf obliged to deduce them; every one may do it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Capacity: 'Tis more convenient to be ſilent, than to ſay ſuch things as are not neceſſary to be known; and which perhaps will one day be more eaſily agreed upon, than they would now. I would only have it known, that the moſt ſimple ways of our Sanctification, are Self-denyal and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; or that at leaſt we ſhould continually reflect, that our Bleſſed <hi>LORD</hi> diſtinctly knowing the Laws of the Order of Grace, we run perpetual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers when we don't follow the wayes that he has ſhowed us, not only by his Words, but alſo by his Actions.</p>
                  <p>But as in the courſe of our Lives there happens particular Occurrances, wherein we don't know which way to determine our ſelves, becauſe of the contrary Reaſons that may be alledged on either ſide, about
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:107782:263"/>certain Opinions; 'twill perhaps be uſeful to ſhow here by ſome particular inſtance, that much uſe may be made of the Principle that we have eſtabliſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> That God alwayes acts by the moſt ſimple means.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe, for inſtance, that I am deſirous to know whether I ought every day to take certain ſtated times to examine my ſelf; to repreſent to my ſelf my weakneſs and miſeries; to conſider my Duty in the Preſence of God, and to beſeech him to aſſiſt me in conquering my Paſſions: Or elſe, whether I ought to ſtay till the Spirit of God, who blows where and when it pleaſes, ſhould take me from my ſelf, and from my ordinary imployments, to unite me to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for very probable Reaſons may be given both for and againſt theſe Opinions; and Men are very often ſatisfied with Probabilities in ſuch like caſes: And this even makes ſome Pious Perſons to follow different wayes, which are not alwayes very ſure.</p>
                  <p>I conſider therefore, that if I ſtay for the particular Motions of the Spirit of God, I ſhall never pray to him; if to that end I don't receive either particular Revelations, Illuminations, or preventing Delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now theſe Illuminations or Delectations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produced by God, by more particular Wills than are thoſe general Wills, which conſtitute the Order of Nature, they are kind of Miracles; ſo that this is to pretend that God impells Men to Prayer, through means that are not the moſt ſimple. Nay, to expect thoſe Graces which are not alwayes neceſſary, is in ſome meaſure to tempt God.</p>
                  <p>But if I accuſtom my ſelf to appear, or endeavour to preſent my ſelf before God at certain Hours, the ſound of a Clock will be enough to remember me of my Duty, without its being neceſſary that God ſhould have a particular Will of inſpiring me with the thought of Praying: The general Laws only of the Union of the Soul with the Body, will make me think of my Duty, when the time that I have choſen ſhall preſent it ſelf by ſome ſenſible mark.</p>
                  <pb n="819" facs="tcp:107782:263"/>
                  <p>But as Self-Examination and Prayer is neceſſary; and as we can't pray without having ſome thoughts of it; nor have theſe thoughts unleſs God gives them: 'Tis ſome ſtep towards Salvation to have theſe thoughts, without obliging God to give them us by particular Wills, which are kinds of Miracles; or rather, in conſequence of the general Laws of the Order of Grace, whereby God would ſave all Men through his Son. Perhaps the want of the firſt thought of Prayer, and of conſidering our obligations before God, is the cauſe of the blindneſs of many Men; conſequently of their Eternal Damnation. For God acting alwayes by the moſt ſimple wayes, ought not by particular Wills, to give thoſe thoughts which might be obtained by vertue of his general Wills, if once perſons were accuſtomed to pray regularly at particular hours. Therefore as God would ſave Men by the moſt ſimple wayes, it is evident that as much as poſſible, we ought to make the Order of Nature ſubſervient to that of Grace; and, as I may ſay, to reconcile Gods Wills together, by regulating a time which may at leaſt ſupply us with the thoughts of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>'Twas for theſe Reaſons probably, that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to write his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Doors of their Houſes, and alwayes to have ſome ſenſible Mark which might put them in mind of them: This ſpar'd God, if I may ſo ſay, thoughts. For Miracles of Grace were very rare amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the time being not yet come where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God deſign'd to ingrave his Law, and infuſe his Spirit and Charity into the Heart of Man.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs that whatever we do, by a mere Natural Power, cannot of it ſelf meritoriouſly diſpoſe us for Grace; and yet without it, all external Religion can only ſerve to maintain our Pride and Self-love. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> grew vain from their bearing the ſenſible Signs and Memorials of the Law of God, as our Saviour reproached them: And Chriſtians often make uſe of Crucifixes and Images, out of Curioſity, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:107782:264"/>or ſome other motive of Self-love. Yet ſince theſe things may put us in mind of God, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to make uſe of them; for we muſt, as much as poſſible, make Nature ſubſervient to Grace, that God may ſave us by the moſt ſimple wayes.</p>
                  <p>For although we cannot Naturally fit our ſelves for Grace, we may often contribute to the rendering it efficacious; becauſe we can leſſen the eagerneſs of a Paſſion, by removing thoſe Objects from us which cauſe it, or by preſenting to our ſelves contrary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to thoſe which inſpire it. Thoſe who moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watch the purity of their imagination, and ſuffer it not to be ſo much corrupted by the continual uſe of ſenſible Pleaſures, and Commerce with the World, make Grace efficacious, by removing that reſiſtance it finds in others. In this ſenſe, even a Diſeaſe, a ſhower of Rain, or any other accident, that keeps us at home, may render Grace efficacious; for ſuch a degree of Grace as would be too weak to make us reſiſt the ſenſible impreſſion of the preſence of an agreeable Object, is ſtrong enough to make us with horrour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the impure thought or imagination of this ſame Object.</p>
                  <p>This is enough to ſhow clearly, that the Counſels of the Goſpel are neceſſary, that God may ſave us by the moſt ſimple wayes: For 'tis advantageous to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; not only becauſe when we follow them by the Motion of Gods Spirit they determine it, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of immutable Order, or of the general Laws of the Order of Grace, to increaſe in us our love to him; but alſo becauſe the practiſing theſe Counſels may often render Grace efficacious, though we are induced to it only by Self-love, as it may happen on many occaſions.</p>

                  <head>A DEFENCE OF THE AUTHOR OF THE <hi>Search after Truth:</hi> Againſt the ACCUSATION OF Monſieur <hi>de la Ville.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SOmetimes ſince there was Publiſhed a Treatiſe, whoſe Title ſurprized many Perſons, and ſtir'd up their Paſſions. Several wiſhed I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt my ſelf in the Quarrel, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had with the <hi>Carteſians;</hi> for as on one hand Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> (for that was his Name) had done me the honour to liſt me among thoſe Philoſophers, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107782:266"/>with what deſign I know not; and on the other hand, diverted himſelf by Traveſtying me in Ridicule: They aſſured me that if I was willing to paſs for a Raſh, Ignorant and Extravagant Perſon, for a Viſionary, nay, even an Heritick; yet I could not in Conſcience deſert the Cauſe of Truth, and leave the Enemies of the Faith the Advantages he granted to them.</p>
                  <p>I muſt be Juſt to theſe Gentlemen, and confeſs their Reaſons were very ſolid; but I would deſire them to believe, that if I did not comply with them, 'twas becauſe others were of a much different Opinion, which to me appeared alſo very reaſonable, and for which indeed I had a greater inclination; for I am not willing to decide about the ſolidity of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Moreover, as Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> is not very tender in matters of Faith, I very well foreſaw that his Treatiſe would make more Noiſe, than it would do Injury to the Truth; and as for my ſelf, I believe he did me no Injuſtice in deſpiſing me; I can aſſure him I contemn my ſelf more than he deſires. 'Tis true my ſelf-contempt is not grounded upon the ſame Ideas that inclined him to treat me ſo diſdainfully as he did; but I could indeed wiſh, that the Reaſons I have for deſpiſing my ſelf were not true, and I would freely conſent that all my ill Qualities were changed into thoſe which he has been pleaſed to beſtow upon me, provided he would except that of <hi>Heretick,</hi> or of a Perſon of a ſuſpicious Faith.</p>
                  <p>Since I know there's nothing ſo dangerous as to ſtir up Mens Paſſions, eſpecially on certain Subjects which defend the moſt violent and unreaſonable from the Reproofs of Reaſon; I believed I ought to be ſilent, leſt I ſhould increaſe the Paſſion I ſaw in ſome Minds; but ſince the Heat is abated, and little Miſchief is to be feared, I think I ought to ſatisfie my Friends, and pleaſe my ſelf. I would not affect a diſdainful Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in reſpect of Monſieur <hi>de la Ville;</hi> I confeſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, that he has ſenſibly offended me; for I am neither a <hi>Stoic</hi> nor <hi>Stupid;</hi> I feel when I am hurt, and am not aſhamed to confeſs it. Publick Accuſation of Hereſie is not eaſie to be born, eſpecially by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107782:266"/>which however unjuſt it may be, yet it fails not to make the Faith of the Accuſed ſuſpected in this Age, more than any other; and no one can be prodigal of this kind of diſreputation, unleſs Charity oblige him to it, which ſeldom or never happens.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not therefore Anſwer any thing to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies wherewith this Author endeavours to blacken me: I ſhall not cite him before the Common Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate for Publick Reparation; nor will I make uſe of any other Methods permitted by the Law of Nature, for the reſtitution of that which I can in Conſcience give up. I am whatever he pleaſes, Ignorant, a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary, but I am no Heretick; I am not ſuſpected of Hereſie at leaſt by thoſe who know me. I confeſs I cannot avoid having my Faith ſuſpected, if a Stranger be permitted to treat me as a <hi>Heretick</hi> upon ſuch Conſequences as he pleaſes to draw from my Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for its impoſſible but the Treatiſe of Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> ſhould have deceived ſomebody. If at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I am ſuſpected of Hereſie, it is an unhappineſs which I cannot help.</p>
                  <p>But if it be a Crime, 'tis not I that have committed it, tis he rather who has drawn ſuch Conſequences, from a Principle, as are not in it. As for me, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own them; believe them falſe and Heretical; and if I ſaw clearly that they were directly drawn from any one of my Principles, I would abandon it; for this Principle would be falſe, Truths being not contrary to one another.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing that Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> had reaſoned juſtly, and fairly deduced Heretical Conſequences from my Principle, neither I nor many others, whom he treats unhandſomely, ſaw not before he had wrote his Book, that theſe Conſequences were contained in the Principle; ſo that his Conduct is unjuſtifiable, which way ſoever it be examined: For in fine, the Articles of Faith depend not upon the Penetration and Extenſion of the Mind of one particular Divine, as I am going to ſhow: And though we ſhould be certain, that ſome Principles included impious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, yet no one has thereby a right to treat thoſe as Hereticks who maintain theſe Principles.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107782:267"/>
                  <p>I confeſs I have ſeen in the Fathers, and eſpecially in St. <hi>Anguſtine,</hi> the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.57. <hi>contra Epiſt.</hi> Manich. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. de Trin. <hi>L.</hi> 10. &amp;c.</note> Principle I have Advanced; but I never found there that of Monſieur <hi>de la Ville.</hi> It appeared to me that this was a Common Notion, That if God ſhould Annihilate all Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the World, all the Matter whereof the World is compoſed would be Annihilated. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted ſeveral Perſons upon this, to ſee if they had the ſame Idea as I had upon the Matter, and their Anſwers confirmed me in my Opinion. I judged by Reaſons which I ſhall ſoon declare, That we could no longer have any direct and natural Demonſtration, that the Soul is diſtinct from the Body, or that ſhe is Immortal, if this Principle be given up. I have ſaid in the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> that I believed that no Conſequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Faith could be drawn from this Principle, which before me was Maintained in <hi>Sorbonne</hi> in the Public <hi>Theſes.</hi> I had almoſt ſaid, that if it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I could explain how this Opinion might be reconciled with what the Fathers and Councils have left us as Matter of Faith, upon the Myſtery of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. In ſine, I diſavowed all Heretical Conſequences, and even the Principle it ſelf, if it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them; which I did not, nor yet do believe.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould I ſay more to clear my Faith from the Suſpicion of Hereſie, even to the moſt Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Could I imagine that any one would be bold enough to place St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and other Fathers, among the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> by condemning in the Perſons of the <hi>Carteſians</hi> and <hi>Gaſſendiſts,</hi> the Opinion of this Holy Doctor, as contrary to Tranſubſtantiation? No doubtleſs; nor durſt Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> himſelf do it, but after an indirect manner. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> advances the preſent Queſtion in an hundred places as an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Principle; he never goes to prove it, ſince it appears not that any Man doubted of it in his Time: For indeed it is a Principle which ought to paſs for a Common Notion with all ſuch whoſe Minds are not prepoſſeſt with Falſe Studies: From thence this Holy Doctor concludes, That the Soul is Immortal; that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107782:267"/>it is more Noble than the Body; that it is diſtinct from it; and many other Truths of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Art.</hi> 6.</note> And Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> advances under Equivocal Terms, That this Principle is not to be found in St. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> He Anſwers one place only in the Works of this Father; and to explain him, makes this Learned Man reaſon after an extravagant manner. In fine, he oppoſes to the Conſtant Doctrine of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> the only Book of <hi>Categories;</hi> as if he knew not that this Work was none of this Fathers, and that it belonged rather to <hi>Logic</hi> than <hi>Phiſics.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not ſtand to prove this in particular; for I ſee no neceſſity of Anſwering Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi>'s Book. I deſign to preſerve inviolable the Reſolution I have made, and which I have declared at the End of the <hi>Preface</hi> of the Second Volume of the <hi>Search after Truth; viz.</hi> That I would not Anſwer all thoſe who ſhould Attacque me without underſtanding me, or whoſe Diſcourſe gave me any reaſon to believe, that ſomething elſe beſides the Love of Truth was the Motive of their Writing; as for others, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſatisfie them. I am unwilling to diſturb others, or break my own Repoſe, by contentious Books, and Treatiſes that are wholly uſeleſs to a <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> and which ſerve only to violate Charity and ſcandalize ones Neighbour; and if I now write, it is becauſe I ought not to ſuffer my Faith to be made ſuſpected, and becauſe I would be clearly underſtood, that no one ought to treat me as an Heretic, upon Conſequences which he can draw from the Principles I have Eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>It is not that I think any Hereſie, nor even any Error, may be drawn from the Book of a <hi>Search after Truth;</hi> I am ready to Anſwer with Charity, and reſpect all thoſe who ſhall do me the Honour to Criticiſe upon me without paſſion; and I ſhall be always ready to follow Truth, as ſoon as it ſhall be diſcovered to me. I diſavow all Principles which may conclude any Error; but I pretend, that thoſe perſons cannot be juſtly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as <hi>Heretics,</hi> who even opinionatively maintain ſuch Principles from which Divines may draw impious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107782:268"/>Conſequences, provided the Defenders of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples diſavow theſe Conſequences; for if this were true, every one might be treated as an Heretic. Theſe are my following Proofs, which are drawn even from what paſſes for Reaſonable in the Common Opinions of Philoſophers; and this not to render them odious Or ridiculous, but that I may prove what I deſign from Univerſally-received Opinions, which <hi>Peripatetics</hi> inſiſt ſo much upon, that they continually inſult over their Adverſaries.</p>

                        <hi>Peripatetics,</hi> and almoſt all Men, believe, That Beaſts have Souls, and theſe Souls are more Noble than the Bodies they Animate. 'Tis an Opinion Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at all Times, and in all Nations, That a Dog ſuffers pain when he is beaten, that he is capable of the Motions of the Paſſions, Fear, Deſire, Envy, Hatred, Joy, Sorrow, and that he knows and loves his Maſter; yet from this Opinion may be drawn ſuch Conſequences as are directly repugnant to what <hi>Faith</hi> teaches us.</p>

                        <head>The Firſt Conſequence contrary to Faith: <hi>That God is unjuſt.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Beaſts ſuffer pain, and ſome are more unhappy than others: Now they have never made an ill uſe of their Liberty; for they never had any. Then God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt who puniſhes them; who makes them unhappy, and unequally unhappy, although they are equally innocent. Then is this Principle falſe, <hi>That under a Juſt God nothing can he miſerable, without having deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</hi> A Principle which nevertheleſs St. <hi>Augustine</hi> makes uſe of againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> to prove Original Sin.</p>
                        <p>Moreover there is this difference betwixt Men and Beaſts, That Men after Death may be happy;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107782:268"/>which recompences the pains they endure in this Life: But Beaſts loſe all at Death; they have been unhappy and innocent, and no Recompenſe attends them. Thus an innocent Man may ſuffer in order to Merit, and yet God be Juſt: But if a Beaſt ſuffers, God is unjuſt.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it may be ſaid, That God may do whatever he pleaſes with a Beaſt, provided he obſerves the Rules of Juſtice in reſpect of Man; but if an Angel thought that God could not puniſh him without having deſerved it, and yet might do what he pleaſed with Man, ſhould we approve of this Thought? Certainly God is Juſt to all his Creatures; and iſ the moſt vile are capable of being miſerable, they muſt needs be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming criminal.</p>

                        <p>The Soul of a Dog is a Subſtance more Noble than the Body it Animates; for according to St.<note n="*" place="margin">De Quantit.

                           <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it is a Spiritual Subſtance more Noble than the moſt Noble Bodies: Beſides, Reaſon ſhows us, That Bodies can neither Know nor Love; that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Pain, Joy, Sadneſs, and other Paſſions, cannot be Modifications of Bodies. 'Tis believed, That Dogs know and love their Maſters; that they are ſuſceptible of the Paſſions of Fear, Deſire, Joy, Sadneſs, and many others. The Soul of Dogs is not then a Body, but a Subſtance more Noble than Bodies. Now the Soul of a Dog is made for his Body; it has no other End or Felicity than the Enjoyment of Bodies: Then the Nature of Man is not Corrupted, and Concupiſcence is no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; God might make Man for the Enjoyment of Bodies; he might ſubject him to the Motions of Cupiſcence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:107782:269"/>
                        <p>Perhaps it may yet be ſaid, That the Soul of Beaſts is made for Man; but this is a weak Subterfuge: For it's indifferent to me, whether my Dog or Horſe has or has not a Soul: 'Tis not the Soul of a Horſe which carries or draws me; 'tis his Body: 'Tis not the Soul of a Chicken which Nouriſhes me, but its Fleſh. Now God could, and conſequently ought to create Horſes, who ſhould do all Things we have need of, without a Soul; if it be true, That he has made them only for our uſe: Moreover, the Soul of a Horſe is better than the Nobleſt Bodies; therefore God ought not to create it for the Body of Man. Laſtly, God ought not to have given Souls to Flies, which Swallows feed upon: Swallows are but of little uſe to Man; they might have fed upon Grain, like other Birds.</p>
                        <p>Why then muſt there be an infinite Number of Souls annihilated to preſerve the Bodies of theſe Birds, ſince the Soul of a Fly is worth more than the Body of the moſt perfect Animals? If then we are aſſured that Beaſts have Souls, (that is, Subſtances that are more Noble than Bodies) we take away from God his Wiſdom, and make him Act irregularly; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Original Sin, and conſequently overthrow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by taking away the Neceſſity of a Mediator.</p>

                           <hi>The Third Conſequence contrary to Faith:</hi> The Soul of Man is Mortal; or at leaſt, the Souls of Beaſts paſs from one Body to another.</head>
                        <p>The Soul of a Beaſt is a Subſtance diſtinct from its Body: Now it is Annihilated; then Subſtances may naturally be Annihilated. Then although the Soul of Man be a Subſtance diſtinct from his Body, it may be Annihilated when the Body is deſtroyed. Thus one may demonſtrate by Reaſon, That the Soul of Man is Immortal: But if we grant as a moſt Certain
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107782:269"/>Truth, That no Subſtance can be naturally Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Soul of Beaſts will Subſiſt after Death; and ſince they are made for Bodies, the leaſt we can infer is, That they paſs from one Body into another; that they may not be uſeleſs in Nature. This is a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which appears more Reaſonable.</p>
                        <p>Now we believe, That God is Juſt and Wiſe; that He loves not Diſorder; that Nature is Corrupted; that the Soul of Man is Immortal, and the Soul of Beaſts is Mortal: Becauſe indeed, 'tis not a Subſtance diſtinct from their Bodies. Therefore in the Language of Monſieur <hi>de la Ville,</hi> which condemns Men from Conſequences which he draws from their Principles, the <hi>Carteſians</hi> may repreſent him as criminal, and all Mankind beſides; becauſe they believe that Beaſts have Souls.</p>
                        <p>What would Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> ſay, if from his own way of Arguing, we ſhould accuſe him of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; becauſe he maintains Opinions, from whence we deduce, That God is not Juſt, Wiſe, Powerful; Sentiments which overthrow Religion, which oppoſe Original Sin, which take away the only Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Reaſon furniſhes us with to prove the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul? What would he ſay, if we ſhould treat him as unjuſt and cruel, for making inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Souls ſuffer, and even Annihilating them, for the Nouriſhment of Bodies which they Animate? He is a Sinner; they are innocent. 'Tis only to nouriſh his Body, that he kills Bodies, and Annihilates their Souls, which are of more value than bodies. Again, If his Body could not ſubſiſt but by the Fleſh of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, or if the Annihilation of one Soul could make him immortal, this Cruelty, however unjuſt it is, might perhaps be pardonable; but how many Subſtances, wholly innocent, does he Annihilate, only to preſerve for a few days a Body juſtly condemned to death for ſin.</p>
                        <p>Would he be ſo little a Philoſopher, as to excuſe himſelf upon the Cuſtom of the places where he lives? But if his Zeal had carried him to the <hi>Indies,</hi> where the Inhabitants build<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107782:270"/>Men, are ſo charitable, even in reſpect to Flies, that for fear of killing them by breathing or walking, they wear a fine Cloath before their Mouths, and fan the Ways in which they paſs; would he then be afraid to make innocent Souls ſuffer, or Annihilate them for the preſervation of a Sinners Body? Would he not rather chooſe their Opinion who allow the Soul of a Beaſt to be no more Noble than their Body, nor diſtinct from it; and by publiſhing this Sentiment acquit himſelf of the Crimes of Cruelty and Injuſtice, whereof theſe People would accuſe him, if having the ſame Principles he followed not their Cuſtom.</p>
                        <p>This Example might be ſufficient to ſhow, That we ought not to treat Men as Heretics and dangerous perſons, becauſe we may draw impious Conſequences from their Principles, even when they diſavow theſe Conſequences: But be it as it will, I think it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more difficult to Anſwer theſe Conſequences that I have now drawn, than theſe of Monſieur <hi>de la Ville.</hi> The <hi>Carteſians</hi> would ve very ridiculous, if they treated Monſieur <hi>de la Ville,</hi> and other perſons who are not of their Opinion, as Impious and Heretical. 'Tis only the Authority of the Church which may decide in Matters of Faith; and the Church has not obliged us, and probably whatever Conſequences ſhall be drawn from Common Principles, will not oblige us to believe, That Dogs have a Soul more Noble than their Bodies; that they know not their Maſters; that they neither Fear, Deſire, nor ſuffer any thing: Becauſe it is not neceſſary, that Chriſtians ſhould be inſtructed in theſe Truths.</p>

                     <p>Almoſt all Men are perſwaded, that ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are true Cauſes of the Pleaſure and Pain which is felt by their means. They believe that Fire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes that agreeable Heat which rejoyces us. That Nouriſhments act in us, and give us the agreeable Senſations of Taſts. They doubt not but 'tis the Sun
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107782:270"/>which ripens Fruits that are neceſſary for Life; and that all Senſible Objects have a Vertue which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them, by which they can do us much Good or Evil. Let us ſee whether we cannot draw from theſe Principles, ſuch Conſequences as are contrary to what Religion obliges us to believe.</p>
                     <div type="consequence">
                        <head>A Conſequence impugning the Firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Morality; by which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to love God with all our Power, and to fear him only.</head>
                        <p>'Tis a Common Notion, according to which all Men act, That we ſhould love or fear whatever has Power to do us good or hurt; to make us ſenſible of Pleaſure or Pain; to make us Happy or Unhappy. This is a ſuppoſed Principle, we ought therefore to love and fear them. This is a Reaſoning which all the World Naturally makes, and which is yet a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Principle of the Corruption of Manners.</p>
                        <p>It is evident by Reaſon, and the firſt of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that all the Motions of our Soul, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Love or Fear, Deſire or Joy, ſhould tend towards God; and that all the Motions of our Body ſhould be regulated and determined by External Objects. By the Morion of our Body we may approach to Fruit, avoid a Blow, fly a Beaſt that would devour us: But we ought to love and fear God only. All the Motions of our Soul ought to tend towards him alone: We ought to love him with all our Power: This is an indiſpenſible Law. We can neither love nor fear what is below us, without being diſordered and corrupted. To be afraid of a Beaſt ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us, or to fear the Devil, is to do them honour. To love Fruit, to deſire Riches, to rejoyce in the Heat of the Sun, as if it were the true Cauſe thereof; nay, even to love ones Father, Protectour, Friend, as if they were capable of doing as good; this is to give them that honour which is due to God only. We
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107782:271"/>muſt not love any one in this ſenſe. 'Tis permitted, and we ought to love our Neighbour, by wiſhing or procuring for him, as a Natural or Occaſional Cauſe, whatever may conduce to his Happineſs, but not otherwiſe. We muſt love our Brethren, not as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing us good, but as of enjoying with us the true Good. Theſe Truths appear evident to me, but Men ſtrangely obſcure them, when they ſuppoſe that Bodies which are about us can act in us as true Cauſes.</p>
                        <p>Indeed the greateſt part of Chriſtian Philoſophers, pretend that Creatures can do nothing, if God did not concur to their Action; and ſo Senſible Objects cannot act in us without the Efficacy of the Firſt Cauſe. We ought neither to fear nor love them, but God only, on whom all things depend.</p>
                        <p>This Explication ſhows, Men condemn the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which I have drawn from their Principle: But if I ſhould ſay with Monſieur <hi>de la Ville,</hi> that 'tis a ſlight of Philoſophers to cover their Impiety; if I ſhould charge them with the crime of maintaining, at the expence of Religion, <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Opinions, and the Prejudices of their Senſes; if by examining their Heart, I ſhould impute to them a ſecret deſire of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching Mens Morals by the defence of a Principle which juſtifies all ſorts of diſorders, and oppoſes the firſt Principle of Chriſtian Morality, by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which I have drawn: Should I be very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable thus to be willing to condemn all Men as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, becauſe of the Conſequences which I might draw from their Principles?</p>
                        <p>Certainly, Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> would ſay my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences were not fairly deduced, and I ſay the ſame thing of his. But to deſtroy all theſe Conſequences, I need only explain his Equivocations, which I ſhall ſometime or other do, as I ſee it neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>But how will Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> juſtifie the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion about the Efficaciouſneſs of Second Cauſes?<note place="margin">See the Explanation about Second Cauſes, in <hi>Vol. 2.</hi> of the <hi>Search after Truth.</hi>
                           </note> And by what kind of Concourſe will he render to God all that is due to him? Will he ſhow clearly that one and the ſame Action is wholly

Will he demonſtrate that the Power of the Creature is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; though without its Efficacy the ſole Action of God would produce the ſame Effect?

And will he from hence convince many whoſe Mind and Heart is wholly poſſeſt with Senſible Objects; becauſe they judge theſe Objects are capable of making them happy or miſerable?

                           <hi>The Conſequence of a Principle propoſed by Monſieur</hi> de la Ville, <hi>as matter of Faith,</hi> That the Eſſence of Bodies conſiſts not in Extenſion. <hi>This Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Principle overthrows the only demonſtrable and direct Proof, of the Souls being a ſubſtance diſtinct from the Body, and conſequently Immortal.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>When this Truth is received (which I think I have demonſtrated after many others, and which Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> attacks nevertheleſs as a Principle contrary to the deciſions of the Church) <hi>That the Eſſence of Matter conſiſts in Extenſion, in length, breadth and depth.</hi> It is not difficult to prove, That the Soul, or that which is capable of thinking, is a diſtinct ſubſtance from the Body: For 'tis manifeſt, the Extenſion of any matter, conceived as diviſible or movable, can never reaſon, will, nor even perceive; ſo that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107782:272"/>
                           <hi>that in us</hi> which thinks, is a ſubſtance diſtinct from our Body. Actual Knowledges, Wills, and Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are actually manners of the exiſtence of ſome ſubſtance. Now all diviſions that happen to Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, can produce nothing but Figures; as all Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, relations of diſtance. Extenſion is incapable of other Modifications. Therefore our Thought, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Senſations of Pleaſure and Pain, are manners of ſome ſubſtances exiſtence, which is not Body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul is diſtinct from the Body; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſerted, we prove likewiſe that it is Immortal.</p>
                        <p>No Subſtance is ever annihilated by the common Power of Nature; for as Nature cannot produce ſomething out of nothing, ſo it cannot reduce any thing that <hi>is,</hi> to nothing. Manners of Being may be annihilated, Roundneſs in a Body may be deſtroyed; for what is Round may become Square; but this Roundneſs is not a Being, a Thing, a Subſtance; 'tis only a relation of inequality in the diſtance which is between the parts that terminate this Body, and that which is at the Center. Thus the relations changing, Roundneſs is no more, but the ſubſtance cannot be annihilated. Now by the Reaſons above, the Soul is not a manner of the Bodies exiſtence, it is therefore Immortal; and although the Body be diſſolved into a thouſand parts of different Nature, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Organs be broken, the Soul conſiſts not in this Conſtruction, nor in any other Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matter: It's evident then that a diſſolution and even an annihilation of the ſubſtance of Mans Body, if the annihilation were real, could not anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate the ſubſtance of our Soul. But there is yet another Proof of the Souls Immortality built upon the ſame Principle.</p>
                        <p>Although a Body cannot be reduced to nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſubſtance, it may nevertheleſs dye, and ſuffer a diſſolution of all its parts; for Extenſion is diviſible. Now the Soul being a ſubſtance diſtinct from Extenſion, it cannot be divided: One can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Thought, a Deſire, a Senſation of Pain or Pleaſure, as one may divide a Square into two or four
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107782:272"/>Triangles: Then the ſubſtance of the Soul is indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, incorruptible, and conſequently Immortal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unextended.</p>
                        <p>But if Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> ſuppoſes, that the Eſſence of Body conſiſts in ſomething elſe beſides Extenſion, how will he convince Libertines that 'tis neither Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial nor Mortal. They will maintain to him that this <hi>ſomething,</hi> in which the Eſſence of Body conſiſts, is capable of thinking, and that the ſubſtance which thinks, is the ſame with that that is extended. If Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> denyes it, they will ſhow him that 'tis unreaſonable; ſince according to his Principle, a Body being ſomething elſe beſides Extenſion, he has no diſtinct Idea of what that can be; and therefore cannot know whether this unknown thing is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of thinking. Will he pretend to convince them by maintaining, as he does in his Book, that the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Body is to have parts without Extenſion? Certainly they will not believe him upon his word; for finding ſo much difficulty in conceiving parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Extenſion, as indiviſible Atomes, and Circles without two Semi-Circles, they muſt have more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for him, than he himſelf has for the Word of God. For Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> in the laſt Part of his Book, pretends, That even God cannot oblige us to believe things that are contradictory; ſuch as are the parts of Body without any actual Extenſion.</p>
                        <p>But Libertines will not be wanting on their part for probable Reaſons, to confound the Soul with the Body. Experience (they will ſay) teaches us, That a Body is capable of feeling, thinking, and reaſoning: That 'tis the Body which feels Pleaſure and Pain: That 'tis the Brain which thinks and reaſons: The weight of the Body depreſſes the Mind: Folly is a true Diſtemper; and thoſe who have moſt Wiſdom loſe it, when that part of the Brain, in which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, grows infirm. The Eſſences of Beings are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, we cannot by Reaſon diſcover of what they are capable; ſo that Reaſon wills we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Experience, and Experience confounds the Soul
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107782:273"/>with the Body, and teaches us that it is capable of thinking. Thus Libertines will reaſon.</p>
                        <p>And indeed thoſe who tell us, we know not the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenees of Beings; and who quarrel with Philoſophers, for demonſtrating that Extenſion is not the Manner of Being, but the very Eſſence of Matter; ought to think upon the miſchievous Conſequences that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from their Principles, and not go about to overthrow all the demonſtration we have brought about the diſtinction that is between the Soul and Body: For in fine, the diſtinction of theſe two parts of our ſelves, proved by clear Ideas, is the moſt fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary of all Truths in Philoſophy, perhaps even in Divinity and Chriſtian Morality. But this diſtinction is more fully ſhown in many places of the<note n="*" place="margin">

                           <hi>Search after Truth.</hi> And I maintain to Monſieur <hi>de la Ville,</hi> notwithſtanding his Anſwer, which is full of Equivocations, Figures and Contradictions; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I maintain to the Libertines; for as for him, I believe him ſo ſettled in his Faith, that he wants not ſuch Proofs: I ſay, I maintain to Libertines, that they will never find any Parallogiſm in my Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; that 'tis impoſſible to conceive it clearly and diſtinctly, without yielding to it; and that all the Proofs they bring to confound the Soul with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are drawn from Senſe, that they are confuſed and obſcure Proofs , and will never convince thoſe who judge of things upon clear and diſtinct Ideas.</p>
                        <p>From this Principle, That the Eſſence of Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in Extenſion, and that the Eſſences of Things are unknown, I might draw yet many Conſequences contrary to Faith; but 'tis unneceſſary: I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it were poſſible, reconcile all true and falſe Philoſophies with Religion; and however Impious and Heretical the Conſequences might be, which I could deduce from the Opinions of Philoſophers, I ſhould think I wanted the Charity I owe them, if I endeavoured to bring their Faith in queſtion; much leſs would I imitate the conduct of Monſieur <hi>de la Ville,</hi> who leaving a Principle fully demonſtrated, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107782:273"/>received in all Ages, and buſies himſelf in drawing Heretical Conſequences therefrom, which only ſerve to confirm the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> by increaſing their number, and troubling the Faith of the Faithful: I would on the contrary, that no one ſhould think on theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; or diſown them as falſe, and unfairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from this Principle.</p>
                        <p>All Truths agree together. One cannot maintain a falſe Principle, but every one that knows but a little of the Art of Reaſoning, may infer from thence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conſequences repugnant to Religion; ſo that if it were permitted to call in queſtion the Faith of others upon Conſequences drawn from Principles by them believed, (as there's no one that is not deceived in ſomething) all the World would ſoon be Heretical. This would be to open the way to an infinite number of Quarrels, Schiſms, Diſturbances, and even Civil Wars; and all Mankind is concerned to look upon the Abettors of ſuch a Conduct, as Calumniators and Diſturbers of the publick Peace: For in ſhort, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parties in Religion, which are almoſt alwayes found upon ſuch like Conſequences, produce ſtrange Events in a State; Hiſtories are full of them; but the liberty of Philoſophizing and Reaſoning upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions, ought not to be taken away from Men; 'tis a right which is as Natural to them, as 'tis to breathe. Divines ought to diſtinguiſh between Theology and Divinity; between the Articles of Faith and Mens Opinions; between the Truths which God teaches to all Chriſtians by a viſible Authority, and thoſe which he diſcovers to ſome perſons as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their attention and pains. They ought not to confound things which depend upon ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Principles. No doubt, Humane Sciences ought to be made ſerviceable to Religion, but with a Spirit of Peace and Charity, without condemning one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo long as we agree in Truths which the Church has decided; for this Truth will ſhine forth; and by adding new diſcoveries to thoſe of the Antients, all Sciences will be brought more and more to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107782:274"/>
                        <p>But the imagination of the moſt part of Men is not adapted to new Diſcoveries, but Novelties of Opinions never ſo advantageous to Religion affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them, and they are eaſily familiarized with the moſt falſe and obſcure Principles, if but advanced by the Antients: But when they are grown familiar with theſe Principles, they find them evident though they are never ſo obſcure; they look upon them as very uſeful, though they are very dangerous; and they accuſtom themſelves ſo much to ſpeak and hear what they underſtand not, and to paſs over a real difficulty by an imaginary diſtinction, that they are alwayes well ſatisfied with their falſe Ideas, and can never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be ſpoke to in a clear and diſtinct Language: Like perſons, who coming out of a dark place, are too apprehenſive of the Light, and cannot indure it, they imagine we blind them, when we indeavour to diſſipate the Darkneſs which ſurrounds them.</p>
                        <p>Thus although I have ſhowed by many Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that it is dangerous, for example, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That Beaſts have a Soul more noble than their Body; yet this Opinion is antient, and moſt Men are accuſtomed to believe it; whilſt the contrary is ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with the Character of Novelty. Thoſe who judge of the harſhneſs of Opinions, rather by the Fear they produce in the imagination, than by the Evidence and Light which they diffuſe through the Mind, will not be wanting to look upon the Opinion of the <hi>Carteſians</hi> as dangerous, and condemn them as raſh and preſumptuous, rather than thoſe who even maintain, that Beaſts are capable of Reaſoning.</p>
                        <p>Let a Man but ſay in company with a grave Air; or rather, with ſuch a one as the Imagination forms when 'tis frightened by ſomething extraordinary, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe</hi> Carteſians <hi>are ſtrange Men, They maintain that Beaſts have no Soul: I am very apprehenſive they will ſoon ſay as much of Man:</hi> And this will be enough to perſwade many that this is a dangerous Opinion. No Reaſons can prevent the effect of this Diſcourſe upon weak imaginations; and if there happens not to be a brisk Wit, and who by a merry Air reimboldens the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107782:274"/>Company, and frees them from the fear they were in, let the <hi>Carteſians</hi> torment themſelves as much as they pleaſe, they ſhall never efforce by their Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Character which is thus given of them.</p>
                        <p>Yet there needs no more to ſhow them the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of this Diſcourſe, than to put the definition in the place of the thing defined: For if a Man ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, <hi>Theſe</hi> Carteſians <hi>are ſtrange Men, They aſſure us that Beaſts neither think nor feel: I am very appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive they will ſoon ſay as much of us.</hi> Certainly one would judge, that this Man would have very little ground for his apprehenſion; but the greateſt part of Men are incapable of extricating the leaſt difficulty, eſpecially when their Imagination is frightened by the Idea of ſome Novelty which is repreſented as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: Beſides, the Air and Deportment eaſily, and even pleaſantly, perſwade us. But Truth is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered without ſome application of Mind, of which the greateſt part of Mankind is incapable.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, Men who know moſt, and whoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are blindly imbraced by the Vulgar, ought not ſo eaſily to condemn their Brethren; at leaſt, before they had examined their Sentiments with a ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: They ought not to inſpire thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully hear them, with diſadvantageous Sentiments againſt their Neighbour. This is againſt all Rules of Charity and Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Carteſians</hi> ſay they, receive Principles whoſe Conſequences are dangerous. I grant it, ſince they will have it ſo; but they own not theſe Conſequences. They are perhaps ſo groſs and ſtupid, that they ſee them not included in their Principles, yet they imagine they can ſeparate them, and think other Philoſophers ought not to be believed upon their word. They are not uncharitable to thoſe who maintain Principles full of dangerous Conſequences, and alſo contrary to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and good Senſe. For in fine, we may eaſily judge by the miſchievous Conſequences which I have drawn from theſe very Principles, upon which <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetics</hi> pretend to triumph over their Adverſaries, how many I might draw from others, and even the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107782:275"/>moſt miſchievous, if I would give my ſelf the trouble of chooſing out of their Body of Philoſophy, the moſt exceptionable. But what advantage ſoever there is in Theological Conteſtations, as alſo in publick Diſputations, I had rather defend my ſelf weakly, than overcome and triumph as an Agreſſor. For in fine, I do not comprehend how theſe, who ſubmit to all the Deciſions of the Church, can be pleaſed in making any Men impious and heretical upon Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences they diſavow. Victory ſeems to me to be fatal, which ſpills the Blood of our own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                        <p>But I believe I have not advanced in the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> any Principle of Philoſophy whoſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are dangerous. But on the contrary, if I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> in ſome places, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> almoſt every where; 'tis becauſe, I cannot reconcile that with Truth, or this either with Truth or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: This I leave to Men of more Judgment and Invention than my ſelf. I have ſaid the Eſſence of Matter conſiſts in Extenſion; becauſe I believe its evident, that I have demonſtrated it; and thereby given clear and inconteſtable Proofs, that the Soul is immortal and diſtinct from the Body.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107782:275"/>what is neceſſary to make an Article of Faith; but I am yet more apprehenſive, leſt Libertines ſhould be fortified in their Sentiments, That the Soul is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and conſequently Immortal. That the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which he thinks is the ſame with that which is extended, becauſe according to them and Monſieur <hi>de la Ville,</hi> Extenſion being only a Manner of Being, whoſe Eſſence is unknown to us, we have no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Reaſon, that this Being is incapable of ſtriking, and we have many Arguments from Senſe: Arguments however falſe they are, yet very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and even demonſtrative to all perſons, that will not be at the pains of Reaſoning.</p>
                        <p>Hence I believe I am obliged to aſſert, with all the Confidence which a ſight of Truth affords me, that I have demonſtrated Extenſion is not a<note n="*" place="margin">

I maintain moreover, that Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> has not ſhown, that this Opinion of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Matter is contrary to Tranſubſtantiation; that he has objected only ſuch Anſwers as are eaſie to be reſolved; that he might more eaſily tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over his Adverſaries; that he has only impugned mine, and probably not ſo much as underſtood them; and that in the humour I now find him, I don't think my ſelf obliged to inform him.

                        <p>As for what reſpects me, I deſire the Readers not to believe Monſieur <hi>de la Ville</hi> upon his word, but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him cautiouſly: Even where he aſſerts with the greateſt Confidence, he boaſts himſelf upon his Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and Ingenuity; and I don't deſire to diſpute
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107782:276"/>thoſe qualities with him, which are indiſpenſable to every honeſt Man; but I cannot forbear ſaying, in defence of Truth, and for my own Juſtification, that he has often forgot himſelf in his Book, of which I will give one notorious Inſtance.</p>
                        <p>In the Frontiſpiece of his Work, he has inſerted an Advertiſement which has an Air of Sincerity; for 'tis compoſed only to make me <hi>a kind of a Reparation:</hi> 'Tis in theſe terms; That there came to his Hands a Copy of the <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> of the <hi>Strasbourg</hi> Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1677, which obliges him to advertiſe his dear Reader, that I had retracted an Error in this Edition, which I had advanced in the firſt: <hi>But it's ſo true, that I either know little in Divinity, or am ſo very preſumptuous, that I could not retract one Error with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advancing two others.</hi> His whole Advertiſement is only to make me a Charitable <hi>Reparation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>However 'tis falſe, (1.) That I retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that pretended Error about Original Sin; the ſame Propoſition being in the ſame words in the Edition he cites<note n="*" place="margin">In the Edition of <hi>Strasbourgh,</hi> p. <hi>190.</hi> In the <hi>1ſt</hi> Edition at <hi>Paris,</hi> p. <hi>172.</hi> In the <hi>3d, p. 107.</hi> In the <hi>4th, p. 95.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) This Propoſition is not my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Opinion, ſince 'tis commonly taught in the Schools: But though it were not taught at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet 'tis certainly no Error, much leſs<note n="†" place="margin">
                              <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note> a <hi>very pernicious one;</hi> as he elſewhere calls it.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) The two Errors which he ſuppoſes me to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in the room of that pretended one, are two things which I never ſaid, and which he puts upon me. Thoſe that read what he has written in relation to the Queſtion, may ſee that what I ſay is Truth; ſo that I ſhall not ſtand to prove it; eſpecially ſince ſome Stranger has ſufficiently done it to my hand: And I could only wiſh, whoever he was, that he had alledged the Reaſons which I had for ſaying, That an Infant at the time of Baptiſm was juſtified by an Actual Love; as I have ſhown in the Explanation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Original Sin.</p>
                        <p>Let any one judge then, after having honeſtly and ſincerely examined the Advertiſement of Monſieur
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107782:276"/>
                           <hi>de la Ville,</hi> if I had not reaſon to deſire the equitable Readers not to credit him upon his Word; for if we believe him, he is the moſt Sincere and Honeſt Man in the World; but if he be carefully examined, we find not over many marks of his Sincerity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. At the end of his Advertiſement, he proteſts he has endeavoured as much as poſſible, to keep all the Moderation he ought: That 'tis only his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Errors he oppoſes; but for their perſons he has much eſteem and reſpect, whilſt yet one can't exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that Advertiſement without diſcovering at leaſt the appearances of a bad Faith, and of a Malign Temper, which ſurprizes and provokes the Spirit. I pray God to pardon his Heat, to regulate his Zeal, and inſpire him with a Spirit of Mildneſs, Charity and Peace, towards his Brethren. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is pleaſed in treating me ſo unhandſomely as he does; but I can aſſure him that I am much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that the neceſſity of defending Truth has obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to ſuſpect his Honeſty; and on the contrary, I ſhould be glad iſ he could know how much I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, reſpect and love him ſincerely in Him, in whom we are all Brethren. <hi>Noverit quam eum non contemnam &amp; quantum illam in illo Deo timeam &amp; cogitem caput noſtrum in cujus corpore fratres ſumus.</hi> Aug. ad Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianum, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 111.</p>
